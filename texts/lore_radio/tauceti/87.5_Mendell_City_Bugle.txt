Happy Holidays to all you wonderful people tonight.

Let's get on with the news.

Braving uncharted territories and uncertain supplies, the Horizon managed to claw its way out of the wild portions of the Crescent Expanse sector, and back into civilized territory.
Just in time for the holidays, as it turns out. Merry Christmas, Horizon.
