City authorities have approved a pilot program to deploy drone-assisted public safety systems in high-traffic zones.
The drones, equipped with advanced sensors and AI oversight, will assist in monitoring traffic flow, reporting accidents, and even responding to minor emergencies.
Privacy advocates, however, are voicing concerns over potential misuse and lack of transparency in the program.
Meanwhile, a recent study conducted by Nanotrasen Academy's Department of Sociology reveals surprising trends in interspecies cooperation.
Researchers found that nearly 78% of Mendell City workplaces now employ a workforce of at least 10% non-human or synthetic workers, a figure that has nearly doubled over the past decade.
Advocates hail this as a step toward a more inclusive and integrated society, though some skeptics warn of challenges in equitable representation.
"There is still a long way to go. Discrimination is still rampant in this country," says Professor Jay Arnold.
"We should honor our country's motto of being a light of liberty."
The city’s famed Grand Amphitheater is set to host an exclusive concert by galaxy-renowned Skrell pianist Xiizol Q’wil.
Known for their ethereal compositions blending traditional Skrell harmonics with human jazz influences, Xiizol Q’wil has captivated audiences across the Spur.
Tickets sold out within an hour. Scalpers have already listed them at nearly triple the original price.
The Grand Amphitheater has condemned the scalping activities. "Everyone should have an equal chance and an equal fee to pay for their beautiful melodies," a spokesperson said.
It is unknown if they will attempt legal action.

Welcome back to the Bugle.
A seayacht belonging to Idris executive and major shareholder Christine Ascaran has sank in Craterview, sources tell the Bugle. Nobody was hurt.
Authorities suspect foul play, as the yacht appeared to be stationary while moored in the town's marina when it sank into the harbor.
Recovery efforts are underway. A spokesperson for Ms. Ascaran has declined to comment.
The Mendell City Spaceport has reported an unprecedented surge in outbound traffic this month as more than 20 million travelers pass through its gates.
Officials attribute the spike to a mix of holiday travel, corporate expansions into the Coalition, and the recent opening of the upgraded spaceport in Xanu Prime.
Despite the rush, the spaceport remains operational with minimal delays.
A surprise auction at the Mendell City Art Exchange last night saw an ancient Skrellian sculpture sell for a record-breaking 120 million credits.
The artifact, known as "Echo of Qi'zqal," is believed to be over 22,000 years old and was recovered from an underwater ruin on Qerrbalak.
The sculpture was significantly eroded by time, although it has kept its overall shape. Curators believe the additional wear adds to the piece's value.
Its new owner, an anonymous bidder, has promised to display the piece publicly in a gallery in Belle Cote.
