Goooood evening, Capital of the Cosmos, and happy holidays to every last one of you out there.
Whether you’re stuck in transit with a gift balanced on your knee, finishing a late shift, or finally home with the lights dimmed and the heater pretending to work, you’ve found the right place.
I’m DJ Neller, and tonight we’re leaning all the way into the season.
Snow’s coming down steady in the upper districts, streetlights glowing like they’re made of gold, and yes, traffic is awful.
But hey. It’s the holidays. We suffer together.
Let’s start gentle.
This one’s been requested nonstop all week, and for good reason.
Warm, familiar, and just a little bittersweet.
Here’s Candlelight Window by Orla Venn.
[RANDOMNOTE] Frost on the glass, city humming low, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Strings of light where the alleys glow, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Every room a borrowed sun, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Counting down till the night’s begun. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Old songs hum through tired halls, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Laughter echoes, then softly falls, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] If you’re lost, you’re not alone, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Every light’s a way back home. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /A quiet instrumental fade-out./ [RANDOMNOTE]
That one never fails.
It’s funny how the holidays have this way of making the city feel smaller.
Same streets, same towers, but suddenly everything’s personal.
Quick reminder before we move on.
The Mendell City Night Market is open late all week in District 3.
Food stalls, handmade gifts, live music, and yes, the spiced cider booth is back.
You’re welcome.
Alright. Don’t wander off.
We’ll be right back after a few holiday messages.
...

/(The cry of a phoenix.)/
Welcome back, you festive phoenixes.
Alright, shifting gears just a little.
This next track’s a classic, but with a modern spin.
Covered this year by Skrellian vocalist Tii’resh Sol, and honestly?
They nailed it.
Here’s Snowfall Lullaby.
[RANDOMNOTE] Hush now, hear the silence sing, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] City wrapped in silver strings, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Every footstep soft and slow, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Under blankets made of snow. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Close your eyes, the night is kind, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Leave the long year far behind, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Tomorrow waits, but not tonight, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Rest beneath the falling light. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /Instrumental with choral undertones./ [RANDOMNOTE]
If you’re driving right now, maybe don’t close your eyes.
But you get the idea.
Alright, I’ve got a guest in studio tonight.
Someone who’s been making a lot of Mendell a little warmer this season.
Joining me is Liora Chen from the Mendell City Shelter Program.
Thanks for being here, Liora.
Thanks for having me, Nel.
Now, the holidays can be rough for a lot of folks.
What’s the situation looking like this year?
Busy. But hopeful. We’ve seen a big uptick in volunteers and donations.
People really do step up when it matters.
Anything listeners should know?
If you’ve got extra blankets, coats, or even just a few spare credits, we can use them.
And if you’re alone this season, our community dinners are open to everyone.
No questions asked.
That’s important to hear.
Thanks for the work you’re doing, truly.
Thank you for helping spread the word.
Alright folks, hug your people if you’ve got them.
And if you don’t, know that you’re still part of this city.
We’ll take one more short break, then come back with something a little brighter.

/(The cry of a phoenix.)/
Alright, we’re back.
Let’s lift the mood just a touch.
This last song for the hour is playful, upbeat, and impossible not to tap your foot to.
A holiday favorite that refuses to take itself too seriously.
Here’s Jingle Orbit by The Starloop Quartet.
[RANDOMNOTE] Bells go spinning round the block, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Midnight trains don’t watch the clock, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Every laugh a spark in flight, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Chasing shadows through the night. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Wrap the world in ribbon bright, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Hold it close till morning light, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] If the year was hard and long, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Let it end in one good song. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /Cheerful instrumental outro./ [RANDOMNOTE]
And with that, we’ll let the music carry you forward.
Wherever you’re headed, whoever you’re with, or even if it’s just you and the city lights tonight, you’re not alone.
This is DJ Neller, wishing you warmth, rest, and maybe just a little magic.
You’re listening to 93.1 Phoenix FM.
Stay bright, Mendell City.
