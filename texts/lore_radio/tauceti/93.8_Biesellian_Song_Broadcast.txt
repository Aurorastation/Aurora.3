Last week’s court held by the High Overseers came to a very interesting conclusion.
With an emphasis on Orthodox teachings in this court session, High Overseer /Connected to the Blossoms Beyond/ spoke at length on Omnipresence and the search for Rootsong Whispers.
These Whispers are said by Orthodox Scholars to be the key to achieving the Omnipresence, and locating them is of great value to the Eternal Temple.
After some behind-the-scenes debate, the three High Overseers unanimously agreed on and, during the court session, announced a new fund.
The /Eternal Temporal Anomalies Research Fund/ is part of a drive to increase scientific interest in the field of Rootsong-based anomalies.
Any research company or group may apply for a grant, with larger sums offered should Eternal dionae be directly involved in the experiment or expedition.
The fund will also offer bursaries for Eternal devout dionae looking to enter the field of anomalies, covering both undergraduate studies and postgraduate Rootsong Anomalies courses.
After the next short break, we shall hear what /Tracing The Unheard Future/ - our guest and an Orthodox scholar - has to say about the High Overseers’ words.

Welcome back, listeners, we are your radio host /Resounding Melody/.
With us now is /Tracing The Unheard Future/ - an Orthodox scholar from the Temple - to discuss the Overseers’ words.
Our nymphs were all fascinated by what the High Overseers discussed, can you tell us what led to this announcement?
/We would be… delighted to. We also all thank… you and the Biesellian Song for your invitation to this radio show./
Thank you for coming! [RANDOMNOTE] /A few chirrups from a nymph are heard!/ [RANDOMNOTE]
/At the core of this… decision is the idea of Omnipresence… which forms one part of… the Trifecta of Omniscience, Omnipotence and Omnipresence./
/To make all parts of this Trifecta whole among every… sapient being in this universe is to… unite the universe’s senses where we will… rejoin with it as One Being./
/The Orthodox School is… particularly concerned with the idea of… Omnipresence, which is the transcension of the temporal conditions sapients are… burdened by./
[RANDOMNOTE] /A nymph chirps, interrupting for it’s gestalt./ [RANDOMNOTE] And this funding initiative will help us with achieving this goal?
/It will. Orthodox Scholars believe… the Voidic Rootsong Network and Rootsong Whispers is… the most opportune place to search for.. the key to Omnipresence./
/Our kind, dionae, have already transcended the past… due to our species’ great memory retention and longevity./
/But the future is not yet transcended…; Rootsong Whispers, which are Rootsong transmissions of… anomalous origin which seemingly appear… from the future… are how we can achieve this./
/By incorporating these Rootsong Whispers anomalies into the Voidic Rootsong Network, we can… bridge the past, present and future in the Voidic Rootsong Network… achieving Omnipresence./
/The Temple’s… generous fund… will hopefully… incentivise scientists - not just dionae scientists and Eternal scholars, but others too - to take interest in these… temporal anomalies exhibited in the… Rootsong Network./
We understand. Thank you, /Tracing The Unheard Future/ for explaining this to us and our viewers.
/We are all… happy to spread these… teachings to all interested. / [RANDOMNOTE] A chorus of several nymphs all chirp in harmony! [RANDOMNOTE]

And we are back, this is your host, /Resounding Melody/, with a bit of news from the Eternal Gardens.
To break the mould, there has been some pleasant news from the Bazaar this week!
Seeking one of the antique stalls in the Bazaar, a human resident of the Eternal Gardens had a vase they recently inherited dated and valued.
Sixty-thousand Biesel Standard Credits the antiquarian said, the resident claims! [RANDOMNOTE] A whole collective of nymphs all erupt into a bewildered, chirpy laughter! [RANDOMNOTE]
The resident who wishes to remain unnamed has said they will be attempting to sell this vase at an auction.
They have also said it was an unexpected but very welcome windfall should it sell, which they wish to use to pay off the rest of their mortgage.
Very good news!
All of the nymphs in our collective do hope they find secure accommodation for this vase, we all know how rough it can be in this district.
On that note, there is some more familiar news:
The /Guardians of the Eternal/ have released information on another series of house robberies and nighttime muggings.
Eternal Gardens residents in the streets bordering District Nine are advised to lock and chain their doors, to lock any windows at night, and to use a password scheme for visitors or expected utility workers.
The vaurca gang responsible are known to employ utility company scams to secure entry to properties; being from the Zo’ra Hive they can be recognised by their orange and red carapaces.
Please report any unusual behaviour or sightings to any local neighbourhood watch groups set up in your area as the Guardians remain overstretched as of late.
With that, we conclude this segment of the Biesellian Song Broadcast. We will be back in the next segment after the long break!
