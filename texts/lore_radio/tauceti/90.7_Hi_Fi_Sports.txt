Goooood evening, Mendell City, and happy holidays to everyone listening across Tau Ceti and beyond!
You’re tuned to 90.7, Hi-Fi Sports, bringing you live play-by-play straight from the diamond here at Frostline Field!
I’m Jake, joined as always by Rob, and tonight folks we’ve got a winter classic on our hands.
That’s right, Jake. Snow flurries in the air, scarves in the stands, and one hell of a matchup to warm you right up.
Tonight it’s the Mendell Cetians taking on the Ashton Mariners in this year’s Republic Winter Series exhibition game.
A festive tradition if there ever was one, Rob. No standings pressure, just pride, bragging rights, and a stadium packed with people who absolutely refuse to feel their fingers.
You can see the steam rising off the crowd right now. Hot drinks, glow-sticks, team scarves, even a few Santa hats on the dugout rails.
The Cetians in their classic midnight blue with silver trim, and the Mariners rocking those evergreen-and-white holiday alternates.
And Jake, don’t let the word “exhibition” fool you. These teams came to play.
Absolutely. Let’s talk starting lineups.
For the Cetians, leading off tonight is shortstop Alina Kersh, followed by center fielder Tomas Virek, and batting third, cleanup hitter and fan favorite, Rashael Delvanni.
And on the mound tonight for Mendell, the veteran southpaw, Luis “Coldfront” Navarro.
Navarro loves these conditions, Jake. Says the cold keeps his arm honest.
Meanwhile for Ashton, they’re sending out rookie pitcher Kenji Matsuo, making his Winter Series debut.
Big moment for the kid. Family reportedly flew in from three systems over just to watch him throw tonight.
Crowd’s settling in now as the lights blaze on. Navarro toes the rubber.
Here we go, folks.
(/The crackle of a PA announcement and distant cheers./)
First pitch of the night…
Strike one! Painted right on the outside corner!
Oh, he came out swinging cold iron there, Rob.
Kersh digs back in, breath fogging the air.
Second pitch… swung on, grounded sharply to third!
Mariners’ third baseman scoops it clean and fires to first…
OUT! One down to start the night.
A crisp opening play. You love to see it.
Up next for Mendell, Tomas Virek.
Virek’s been hot all season, Jake. Quick hands, quicker instincts.
Navarro peers in, sets… here’s the pitch.
Swung on and lifted high to right field!
That ball’s carrying… drifting…
And it’s caught just shy of the warning track! Two outs!
Not quite enough muscle there, but the crowd liked the effort.
That brings us to Delvanni.
And listen to this place, Jake.
(/The crowd erupts in cheers./)
You could power half the city off that reaction alone.
Matsuo takes a deep breath on the mound. First pitch…
Cracked! That one’s lined down the left-field line!
It bounces fair into the corner!
Delvanni’s rounding first, digging for two!
The throw comes in…
SAFE at second! A stand-up double to light up the holidays!
Ho ho ho, indeed! That’s how you start a winter ballgame.
But Matsuo limits the damage, and that’ll end the top of the first.
We head to the bottom now, scoreless but buzzing.
Mariners up to bat, and Navarro looks locked in.
Leading off for Ashton is second baseman Julian Reyes.
Navarro winds… delivers…
Swing and a miss! That heater had frost on it.
Reyes shakes it off. Next pitch…
Tapped weakly back to the mound! Navarro fields it himself and tosses to first.
One pitch, one out.
Efficiency is the gift Navarro brought tonight.
Next up, Mariners’ slugger Hannah Quon.
She’s dangerous, Rob. Especially early.
Navarro checks the runner-less field, nods…
Pitch is hit high to center!
Virek tracks it…
Settles under it…
And makes the grab. Two down.
Cold air killing the carry tonight, Jake.
Final batter of the inning, catcher Milo Brenner.
Here’s the pitch…
Strike three looking! Froze him solid!
And that’s a one-two-three inning for Navarro!
After one, still scoreless here at Frostline Field, but the energy’s building.
Stay with us, folks. This one’s just getting warmed up.

Welcome back to Frostline Field, folks.
Second inning underway, still scoreless, but you can feel it tightening up.
The Cetians back at the plate, and Matsuo’s settling into his rhythm.
First pitch to designated hitter Corin Hale…
Swung on, chopped up the middle—through for a base hit!
There we go. First runner aboard for Mendell.
Momentum shift maybe starting here, Rob.
Absolutely. Cold games turn on little things.
Next batter squares to bunt…
Down the third-base line!
Perfectly placed! Hale advances, throw to first—
SAFE! That’s textbook small ball.
Mendell threatening early here in the second.
Crowd leaning forward now, scarves forgotten.
Navarro may have brought the cold, but the Cetians are bringing the heat.
And folks, stick around. Snow’s falling heavier, bats are cracking louder, and this Winter Series classic is shaping up to be something special.
Back to the action after this.
