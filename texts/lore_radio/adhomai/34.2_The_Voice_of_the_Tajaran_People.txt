“Fellow Tajara, they have gathered here to celebrate the peace among all Tajara.
For ten years they have fought to keep the flame of Hadiism alive, and they have been victorious. 
Through the determination and heroism of their people and allies, they have stopped those who tried to destroy the dreams of a united and free Tajaran people. 
Even when Adhomai and its people are not together, as it was during the times of Al'Mari, they will continue to strive for this ideal!
/The sound of a crowd cheering and clapping interrupts the speech for multiple minutes./
“The People’s Republic of Adhomai will continue to unite all Tajara under its banner, even the ones living outside of our system, so they may secure their destiny in this universe. 
Let it be known to their allies and enemies; the victory of Hadiism is inevitable, and every citizen of their glorious Republic will fight for it!”
/The ovation from the crow continues./
