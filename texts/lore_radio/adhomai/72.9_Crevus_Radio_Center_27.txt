Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is Crevus Radio Center 27 calling out to them from Adhomai’s shining pearl. 
Now as they all know, this is their wondrous Mister Crevus speaking to them and wishing them a wonderful day. 
Now don’t turn off that radio! We’ll begin the tunes soon, but first a word from our sponsors… The Rredouane’s Palace! Enjoy a party worthy of the gods! That’s right folks, the Rredouane’s Palace is beckoning them to come on in, take a load off, and enjoy the high life. Just don’t forget to pack a heavy wallet, alright?
And now here’s a rising star in the Crevan punk scene, it’s the Suns-Eaters!
[RANDOMNOTE]/A blaring punk dirge with a woman screeching over it begins/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to go![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to hide![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]She’s going to find him![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]And now it is his turn to be afraid![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]/Blaring punk music continues to play/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]The streets are dark, she’ll find him![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Raskara! RASKARA![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]The moon will seduce him with her eyes, she will ask them“Do he remember that girl?”.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Now he is afraid![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]/Blaring punk music continues to play/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to go![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to hide![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]She’s going to find him![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]And now it is his turn to be afraid![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]The streets are dark![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]... And she’s gonna find him…[RANDOMNOTE]
{RANDOMNOTE]/The punk song trails off./[RANDOMNOTE]
Wow, folks. What a voice on that dame, huh? Reminds him of his last girl… Suns, what a firecracker! Come and see the Sun-Eaters live in Crevus before they kick off their Das’nnra tour! 
Now before we begin our next segment, he’d like to ask his darling listeners if they’ve thought of doing the adventure of a lifetime. And no, he’s not trying to rope them into being on a smuggler crew! Come and see the frozen north of Adhomai through J’Shar Travels! Just remember to watch out for the plasmageists. No one wants frizzed out fur on their vacation.
Coming up next is the latest hit by Generr Morr’sori, and this one’s a real dozy folks. 
[RANDOMNOTE]/A slow and sad string tune begins to play, with a male Tajara lamently singing/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]When he closes his eyes and dreams, he’ll kiss her once again[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He’ll pretend, yes he’ll pretend[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]And when he whispers “I love you” he wants you to be his[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He’ll pretend that she’s by his side[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Then he’ll pretend that she is his blushing bride[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]/A slow and sad string tune continues to play/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He wishes he knew what he did dear…[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]To make her treat him so…[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Was she pretending?[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Did she ever love him…?[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]/A slow and sad string tune continues to play/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]In his dreams, he’s tried to find someone as sweet as her[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He knows he won’t dear, but he’ll pretend[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]And when he takes her in his arms[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]And kiss her, tenderly.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He’ll just pretend dear, that she is kissing him[RANDOMNOTE]
Sheesh. Now he feels like a wreck. Nothing like a sad song to remind them how bad life can be, eh folks? Ah, who is he kidding- We live on Adhomai! Reminders here fall as easily as rain from the sky. 
But what doesn’t come so easily? Good seafood. Now he knows every single person’s got a tale of stomach woes but what if he could tell you that there exists a place where the fish are cooked to perfection? The Minharrzka’s Heart is always giving some of the best seaside dining on this world. And rumour is, if one brings their own fishing rod, they can get their catch cooked! Kidding folks, kidding. Don’t try that. 
Now he’s going to go off the radio for a bit, but don’t worry their heads too much folks. Your darling mister Crevus will be back after this short break…
