They are back to their regular broadcasting with another episode of their famous radionovela, Cold Souls and Warm Hearts!
/A short jiggle plays before a narrator begins to speak with a grave voice:/
In the previous episode of Cold Souls and Warm Hearts, their heroine, Yuldus, was caught by a Hadiist patrol while trying to smuggle weapons for the Royalist resistance.
She notices that the unit's commissar was one of her boyfriends from her youth. Can she convince him to let her go?
/A female Tajaran voice begins to speak:/
Oh, Levhkir! Does she not recognize her!? They had known each other since they were young, even before they could walk or talk!
/A male Tajaran voice replies:/
Yes, he remembers her. However, she was caught carrying multiple rifles and pistols inside her bag. What is she planning to do with these?
As they know, they suspect that a rebellious group is acting in this area to topple down the glorious rule of President Hadii, praise his name!
/A female Tajaran sighs before replying:/
Oh, no! These guns are for her brothers! They are planning to hunt some…
Some, uh, Sham'tyr..;?
/The narrator describes the scene:/
Levhkir folds his ears back. He is suspecting that something is wrong. He places his hand on his weapon.
/A male Tajaran voice asks:/
Why would they need so many rifles and pistols? This is very strange…
/A female Tajaran voice replies:/
There is a Sham'tyr infestation north of here!
Oh, Levhkir, she is so afraid of the village's children!
What if they are carried away by one of these evil creatures?
Maybe he can prove himself worthy to her once again if he gets there before her brother hunts the Sham'tyr!
/A male Tajaran voice speaks enthusiastically:/
Great idea, Yuldus!
Soldiers, get the rifles and they will hunt down these Sham'tyr!
Yuldus, stay here while they handle the job!
/The sound of marching can be heard before a female Tajaran sighs of relief:/
Suns, that was close…
But, she has no guns now and they will probably notice her lie!
What can she do?!
/The narrator speaks:/
Yuldus might have escaped this time, but her lies can get her so far!
How can she avoid the wrath of the commissar when he finds out he was deceived by their heroine?
Find out in the next episode of Cold Souls and Warm Hearts!
/A short jiggle plays./
What an interesting history and incredible acting!
Makzhir can not wait to find out what happens next…
