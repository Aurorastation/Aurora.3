[Hard rock guitar intro]
[RANDOMNOTE] They keep asking where I’ll be tomorrow, where the Navy sends me! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I don’t know where, I don’t know how! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Wherever Szalai sees me! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Get me out! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Oh, get me out! [RANDOMNOTE]
[Music]
[RANDOMNOTE] When we were younger, the Navy seemed easy, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] But now patrol without ceasing! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I need someone, I need a relief, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To get me out! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Oh, to get me out! [RANDOMNOTE]
[Music]
That was Get Out by the Fellgevar Underground, listeners!
We’ll be back after a short word from our sponsors.
/Ksssshhhhh.../

That’s enough from me. Let’s keep the day rainy with some songs!

/Kssshhhttt.../
[Upbeat synth intro]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’ll be your million credit dream girl!~ [RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE] And we’ll sail together for-eveeeerrr~ [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Across the stars and space! [RANDOMNOTE]
[Synth music]
/Khhhrrrtttt.../
That was, ah, Million Credit Girl, by the Helios Beach Club. Taktak, popular, but not my taste.
Boze, the listener is always right though.
One more before break! This one is more Visegradi! It’s Raining — yes, that’s the real title! — by Forest Brother Blues.
/Fssshhhh.../
[Music]
[RANDOMNOTE] Rain-ing rain-ing, standing all alone. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Waiting all alone, I’m feeling so tired — I want to go home. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Faces pass me places don’t, getting soaking wet, I want to be home. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’m trying my best, I want my rest, but I’m getting cold. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Rain-ing rain-ing, what a fool I’d be, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To say that I tried, that I could be free. [RANDOMNOTE]
/Bzzzrrrtt.../
Want a waterfront view without going to Silversun? Stop by the Lazy Szazlabu coffee shop at 1920 Piłsudski Street today!
We’re just a block away from the Waterfront Station stop of the monorail’s green line.
/Ksshhh.../
Serve our Alliance, see the Spur. Join the Solarian Navy today.
The Navy made Admiral Szalai into the woman she is today. What’s your hidden potential?
/Kzzzhhhtttt.../
