You are listening to Morozian Classics, a production of the Imperial Institute of Cultural Affairs, broadcasting from Domelkos.
We broadcast great works of Morozian opera and classical music.
Give thanks to our magnanimous royal family for their patronage of the arts.
May Our Lady of Moroz bless your day, listeners.
/Kzzzzhhhhhtttt.../
And now, a sample from the opera Daybreak.
[Music swells]
/Alas!/
/How it grieves me to see our Countess fall a slave to her sickness!/
/Quickly, young Wei, bring her to me./
/At once, my Lord!/
[Music]
/Ah, kindly Lord Erik; whence came the strange vessel you now clasp so eagerly to your breast?/
/Countess Emiliana; it was brought to you from Domelkos./
/And who of your men obtained it?/
/Young Wei! Up, Wei! Come!/
/My Countess; this elixir shall restore you!/
/It has been blessed by Our Lady Herself!/
/Shall it? Or shall it send me to Her embrace?/
[Music]
/I rot upon my litter.../
/Let us discard caution and place our faith in Her!/
[Music swells!]
/What sorcery?! I am restored!/
/Let us give our thanks, to Her, our Lady of Moroz.../
/... as we march onwards to conquest!/
[Applause, cheering]
/Kzzzhhhhhrrrrttttt.../

[RANDOMNOTE] I was glad when they said unto me, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] We shall go into the Kingdom of Moroz. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Our souls laid bare, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Shall stand before Her eternal majesty. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] On our Moroz’s green and pleasant scenes. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] And there shall shine; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Her countenance divine. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Upon Her mighty realm. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I shall be true as She is divine, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] In Her name, [RANDOMNOTE]

We at Morozian Classics would like to extend a toast to our noble defenders: His Imperial Majesty’s Fleet.
Please enjoy this recording of the Zhurong March, our noble Fleet’s march.
Long live the Emperor!
[Music]
[RANDOMNOTE] Whether at home or abroad; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] On defense or attack; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Count on Zhurong’s castles! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Floating fortresses of our Empire’s wrath; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To guard the Empire’s lands and seas! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Vessels armed and armored with steel; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To defeat the Empire’s foes! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] They leave behind wakes of shimmering warp; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] That drift through space like a yastr! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] They fire their guns with deafening booms; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] That make our enemies run and scatter! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Thousands of miles through the void; [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Zhurong’s castles sail for glory! [RANDOMNOTE]
[Applause, cheering]
