That was New Future by /GUILLOTINE KISS/!
AW, YEAH! [A flurry of chirrups are heard by the skrell DJ!]
Stars, that was so fucking algae.
GUILLOTINE KISS is easily my favourite spark band; they will certainly shine bright.
Heed their message!
/Bzzzzhhhhhrrrrttttt.../
[RANDOMNOTE] [Some gentle guitar strums enter...] [RANDOMNOTE]
Here we haaaaaaaaaaaaave--
/WithoutCrew!/
Playing... /Heat Death!/
[RANDOMNOTE] [The strumming builds, and a drum symbol is gently sounded...] [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The ship sings of a slow decline, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The hull bends with a painful whine. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] A star dies, which one next time? [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Hear the shaitain: a coming sign. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] [The drums crash down, and a slow, arpeggio guitar solo plays...] [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] [The solo continues to build, distortion added!] [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To the Grand Captain we all went, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] "The stars are dying, give your assent!" [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Chasing the final stars, we were sent, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] SURVIVAL BENT! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Cling to the light and give me your ear, [RANDOMNOTE] 
[RANDOMNOTE] We were made for this, you and our aiseheer! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] There's a star not far, just persevere, [RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE] Balance the scales at your feet, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] How much barley, rice, how much buckwheat? [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Slay the last hakhma for meat! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Cut him loose, only the best can eat! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] [Another guitar solo plays, the volume simmering down...] [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Here at the universe's final breath, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] By the ship's grace, we did cheat death. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] For how long? Not very long, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] but all we can do is carry on. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] It's not quite tujmansaal, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Never will we see a port of call, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] But we'll be the last to see the nightfall. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] [A guitar's arpeggio solo slowly fades out...] [RANDOMNOTE]

That was /WithoutCrew/, playing /Heat Death/!
I've not followed them much, but stars...

[The skrell DJ lets out a guttural warble...]
Oh, shit.
Am I zipped or whaaaaaaaaaat?
...
[A throaty croon...]
Nope.
...
GUUUUUUUUUUUUPPY ALERT! We got a biiiiiiiig ship entering the region.
Be careful out there, that's a chunky bluespace signature.

Ship just a little bigger than the pirate lord's, YOWZA!

I gotta scoot and warm some sqrugs of mine.
Lemmie quickly loop this for the rest of the day...

[The skrell can be heard knocking some things over, croaking all ther while.]
