Man on the Moon, send your shuttle code.
...
Alright, you're good. Docking Arm Seven, third port, is waiting for you.
Tell the captain the boss wants a word.
...
Nah, he hasn't got a choice.
...
Alright, good. Out.
/Kssssshhhhhttttt.../
/Kzzzzhhhhhttttt.../
/Bzzzhhhhrrrrtttt.../
ICV Penthesilea, good to hear from you!
...
Shit! Alrightalrightalright!
Arm Seven, Any Port. I'll have a maintenance team there by your arrival!
/Hey, Melvin!?/
...
Penthesilea, maintenance team is staging. What can they expect?
...
Relayed.
...
Alright, listen carefully: Melv's asking if you've already cut the reactor's fuel injections?
...
Okay, good! Before you can dock then, we need you to crank your gyrotrons up.
...
As high as they go, Melvin's saying. Divert power from weapons and shielding systems if you haven't already.
...
...
Alright, well done. You're clear to dock; Arm Seven, Any Port.
Melv's staged with the maintenance team now. You're in good hands.
Out.
/Kzzzzzhhhhrrrrtttttt.../
/Bzzzhhhhrrrrtttt.../
/Kkkkzzzzzzzhhhhtttt.../
/Kssssshhhhhttttt.../
Purple Fields, received.
You're clear to dock. Let's see-
...
Arm Two, Port One.
...
Ah, received.
Hangar Eight, any pad.
...
Sweet, out.
/Kssssshhhhhttttt.../
/Kzzzzhhhhhttttt.../
/Bzzzhhhhrrrrtttt.../
Hey, Bill.
...
How's the patrol going?
...
Figured.
Good to hear from you anyway.
...
Yeah, keep a look out for those tricksy toads.
Sick of them jamming me.
...
Yeah, that's right. One of the Xar'key systems... I don't fucking know...
They're probably why this fucking radio set up is so broken.
...
Good luck on another lap of the system.
You definitely got enough supplies on you?
...
Alright, great!
...
Yeah, out.
/Kzzzzzhhhhrrrrtttttt.../
/Bzzzhhhhrrrrtttt.../
/Kkkkzzzzzzzhhhhtttt.../
/Kssssshhhhhttttt.../
Unidentified vessel, halt and identify.
...
Unidentified vessel, identify immediately.
...
Black Hegoranssssssssssssssssi? Speak clearer.
...
Yeah, that's not a ship name on our whitelist.
Hold position right there.
...
Come in, No Gods No Kings?
...
Yeah, we got some freighter, fifteen gigametres out, not on the list.
Probably some no name smuggler here for their first time.
...
No, I don't need them pasted. Just a ship search and first payment collection.
...
Black Hegeranzi, hold position while we send a team down to greet you.
Cut your propulsion and weapon systems in the meantime. We don't want any misunderstandings.
...
Mhm, out.
/Kssssshhhhhttttt.../
/Kzzzzhhhhhttttt.../

/Kzzzzzhhhhrrrrtttttt.../

Oh, good haul! You hit some Orion mobile station or something?

Boss'll be happy.
