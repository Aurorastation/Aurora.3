# Map Merger

Before any change to a map, it is good to use the Map Merger tools. In a nutshell, it rewrites the map to minimize differences between different versions of the map (DreamMakers map editor rewrites a lot of the tile keys). This makes the git diff between different map changes much smaller. More recently a new way of laying out the map was invented by Remie, called TGM, this helps to further reduce conflicts in the map files.

This is good for a few reasons

- Maintainers can actually verify the changes you are making are what you say they are by simply viewing the diff (For small changes at least)

- The less changes there are in any given map diff, the easier it is for git to merge it without running into unexpected conflicts, which in most cases you have to either manually resolve or require you to remap your changes

However - to do all this is going to require you to put some elbow grease into understanding the map merger tool.

## Using the tools

1. **Install Python 3.5 or greater** - If you don't have Python already installed it can be downloaded from: https://www.python.org/downloads/ - make sure you grab the latest python 3, again, it must be 3.5 or greater 

2. **PATH Python** - This step is mostly applicable to windows users, you must make sure you ask the windows installer to add python to your path. If you have already installed python you may need to manually add it to your path as indicated in this guide 

3. **Prepare Maps** - Run "Prepare Maps.bat" in the tools/mapmerge/ directory. 
4. **Edit your map** - Make your changes to the map here. Remember to save them! 
5. **Clean map** - Run "Run Map Merge - TGM.bat" in the tools/mapmerge/ directory. 
6. **Check differences** - Use your git application of choice to look at the differences between revisions of your code and commit the result. 
7. **Commit** - Your map is now ready to be committed, rejoice and wait for conflicts.

## Common pitfalls

Do *not* open the map in dreameditor before committing the results of the mapmerger - this can cause dreameditor to resave the map back to dmm, if you're having issues with your map getting stuck in dmm mode, try committing and pushing the mapmerger changes before reopening in dreameditor.

## Map Conflict Fixer/Helper

The map conflict fixer is a script that can help you fix map conflicts easier and faster. Here's how it works:

### Before using

You need git for this, of course. Make sure your development branch is up to date before starting a map edit to ensure the script outputs a correct fix.

### Dictionary mode

Dictionary conflicts are the easiest to fix, you simply need to create more models to accommodate your changes and everyone elses.

When you run in this mode, if the script finishes successfully the map should be ready to be committed.

If the script fails in dictionary mode, you can run it again in full fix mode.

### Full Fix mode

When you and someone else edit the same coordinate, there is no easy way to fix the conflict. You need to get your hands dirty.

The script will mark every tile with a marker type to help you identify what needs fixing in the map editor.

After you edit and fix a marked map, you should run it through the map merger. The .backup file should be the same you used before.

#### Priorities

In Full Fix mode, the script needs to know which map version has higher priority, yours or someone elses. This important so tiles with multiple area and turf types aren't created.

Your version has priority - In each conflicted coordinate, your floor type and your area type will be used Their version has priority - In each conflicted coordinate, your floor type and your area type will not be used

### IMPORTANT

This script is in a testing phase and you should not consider any output to be safe. Always verify the maps this script produced to make sure nothing is out of place.
