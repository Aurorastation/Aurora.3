# Tools

**Tools** is folder that contains many useful tools. Such as mapmerge,
dmi conflict resolution tool, tag matcher, midi2piano, generate changelog,
and so many more.

## Installation

To install Python dependencies, run `requirements-install.bat`, or run
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` directly.

## Notes

the compiled exe file for the Unstandardness text for DM program is in:
UnstandardnessTestForDM\bin\Debug\UnstandardnessTestForDM.exe
of
UnstandardnessTestForDM\bin\Release\UnstandardnessTestForDM.exe

You have to move it to the root folder (where the dme file is) and run it from there for it to work.
