            Please configure your pAI personality&apos;s options. Remember, what

            personality chooses you!

            What you plan to call yourself. Suggestions: Any character name you

            What sort of pAI you typically play; your mannerisms, your quirks,
            etc. This can be as sparse or as detailed as you like.

            Do you like to partner with sneaky social ninjas? Like to help
            security hunt down thugs? Enjoy watching an engineer&apos;s back
            while he saves the station yet again? This doesn&apos;t have to be
            limited to just station jobs. Pretty much any general descriptor for
            what you&apos;d like to be doing works here.

          <Section title="OOC Comments">
            Anything you&apos;d like to address specifically to the player
            reading this in an OOC manner. &quot;I prefer more serious
            RP.&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m still learning the interface!&quot;, etc.
