		FROM: CAPTAIN DENISA HRUSKA <br>\
		SUBJECT: SITUATION REPORT <br>\

		We are running out of asteroids we can exploit. Or at least with the personnel and supplies that we have. <br>\
		We are lacking competent engineers, and our systems are constantly broken or running at reduced capacity. <br>\
		We need tools, food, air, fuel. A second fusion reactor. Solar panels. Electronics. Spare shuttle parts. <br>\
		<br>\
		<br>\
		Crew manifest as of today: <br>\
		- Denisa Hruska - Captain <br>\
		- Anna Jelinek - Miner Specialist <br>\
		- Frantisek Bartos - Miner <br>\
		- Tomas Hruby - Pilot <br>\
		- Fiala Dvorakova - Atmospherics Engineer <br>\
		- Jiri Ruzicka - Cook <br>\
		<br>\
		<br>\
		I am aware it is even smaller crew than last week. <br>\
		Crew is not happy about all of this. And so, more and more are just leaving, even before their contracts end. <br>\

		Honestly, I don't even know why I write these anymore. <br>\
		This station is falling apart, we are in the middle of nowhere, and everything is going to shit. <br>\
		Half the people left already. Dvorakova literally boarded the first passing freighter. <br>\
		I'm leaving too when my contract ends. Just really need that cash to send back home. <br>\
		Probably apply to Orion or something. <br>\
		<br>\
		Pretty sure Frantisek is hiding something in the kitchen. <br>\
		Seen them stare at the booze vendor there a lot. <br>\
		They been talking about the solarian threat or something too. <br>\
		Guess it's not just me going crazy. <br>\

		Hi, Dvorakowa here. I know you're new here, but I would explain this in person if I wasn't leaving this shithole. <br>\
		There are four big tanks on the outside: CO2, phoron, H2, breathable air. Order is from closest to control room. Do not confuse them. <br>\
		Just follow the pipes to turn on the valves and pumps, and fill a canister or whatever you're doing. Good luck. <br>\
		<br>\
		<br>\
		Oh and btw watch out for Frantisek. They're shady and weird, pretty sure they're hiding something. <br>\
		I couldn't sleep last night, went to the kitchen, saw them putting something behind the booze cabinet there. <br>\
		Weird shit. <br>\

		Yo, my man. <br>\
		Can't catch you lately, where you been? Hope you ain't took off like some others without saying a word. <br>\
		If you still here, we been doing a card game lately, and you invited. <br>\
		Big cash in it though, so bring whatever you got. Know you still got that gold watch you found last month. <br>\
		<br>\
		If you interested, we play every friday. Place is in maint tunnel between bridge and engineering. <br>\
		We got like a poker table and booze and stuff. Some entertainment before this place falls apart. <br>\
		<br>\
		Don't tell Anna I told you, but we put the goodies in the trash cart. <br>\
		If they see you touching that cart, your leg gonna get the ore stacker treatment, so that's a warning, yo. <br>\
