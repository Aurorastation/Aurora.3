	- \[11 FEB 2274 - CYCLE 451 - ATKINSON\] Regular check-up, all green. Lately we allocate more and more processing space for the labs, even though these equipments
	weren't meant to pull off such an intense workload. We may be in the middle of damn nowhere, but hoping for miracles won't get you too far either. Put a ticket,
	get us some proper hardware and then maybe you will see less blinking red lights in the box that we have to pulse to reboot every now and then.

	Babe, if you find this note pick whatever you can. Meet me at the hangar bay, we're leaving the first chance we get. Just today <i>two more</i> search and rescue teams
	went missing, and now medbay isn't accepting like, patients. More people are getting sick. Now we have a pilot too, that's the chance! I hope you change your mind, wholeheartedly.

	We have been holding the cafeteria for some time now. Keeping watch in turns, scare <i>them</i> away where we can. At first it seemed promising, we had plenty
	tables here to block the entry and enough food to feed an entire floor for months. It was a brief solace to know we won't starve while the sickness was getting inside our heads.
	<br><br>
	Comfort is a slow death, they say. We were ambushed. Most of us thought it was sickness bogging down our sanity, but those damnable things lurk in the ventilation.
	We lost three good men. If you be smart about it and move slowly around vents, the chances are they won't notice you. Welding them shut will keep you safe.
	You can also try thowing stuff near vents, might make <i>them</i> curious. Whatever you do, DON'T run pass them, unless you have a death wish...
	<br><br>
	We heard the rumours of a search-and-rescue team returned from the depths, claiming tunnels are connecting to some caverns in a junction, where <i>them</i> have no way
	of reaching for now. We are headed there.
