		Dear Horizon Engineer(s), <br><br>\
		Terrific good job getting this warp core to an operational state. You did quite alright!<br>\
		My team have gone and eliminated some of the most prominent risk factors identified during this week's extensive testing, and we've included some upgrades for you to contend with.<br>Most notably, a phoron cooling array for the now two, integrated fusion reactors.<br>\
		We couldn't leave any phoron for you behind in our rush back to the ship - you will need to source some on your own. Helium-3 for the reactors should be around and about this station.<br><br>\
		Now, should the worst come to bear - and we all hoping this gate is activated before any pirates arrive - one of my technicians had a most fanciful idea.<br>\
		Using the warp gate (or its primary core) as a weapon! Pack some material at the front (the denser the better; phoron could lead to some lovely fireworks too!), then activating the warp core at reduced strength (just one Helium-3 canister) aimed at the Malebranche, could do some shocking damage.<br>\
		I shall leave you with the idea. God speed, engineers.<br><br>- de Winter, NCS Engineering Officer"
