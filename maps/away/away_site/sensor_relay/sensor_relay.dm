The project to deploy these in sectors across the galaxy was started years ago by an extremely rich Solarian investment banker, claiming that it'd be 'The next best thing since lighthouses!'. The project actually went well, making a lot of profit by selling sensor data to civilian and military entities alike, but funding dried up after the inventor passed away. Now, these relays are used as temporary resting points for weary travelers looking to save a dime."
