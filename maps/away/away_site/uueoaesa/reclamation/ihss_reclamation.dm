	If you wish to not end up like others, you are to at least try to understand the following before entering:<br>\
	<ol><li>Approach the cell slowly.</li><li>Do not touch or <u>shake</u> the fence.</li>\
	<li>Do not knock on the glass.</li><li>Do not put their appendages or tail through the fence holes.</li>\
	<li>Have means of escape prepared in event of containment failure.</li>\
	<li>Check cell exterior periodically, if damage to cell is seen, engage the lockdown <b>immediately</b>.</li>\
	<li>Do not unbolt or especially <i>open</i> the cell door unless you know what you are doing.</li>\
	<li>The Skrazi is not to be used against any 'hostiles'. Stop asking.</li>\
	<li>Put only food items in the delivery chute.</li>\
	<li>Do not fall into the delivery chute. Rescue attempts are <u>not</u> to be made before the Skrazi is sedated.</li>\
	<li>The cell is to be cleaned weekly. <b><u>Do not forget to sedate the Skrazi before entering the cell.</u></b></li>\
	<li><b>Do not taunt the Skrazi.</b>.</li></ol>"
