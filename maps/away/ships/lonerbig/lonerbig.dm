Designed to haul significant amounts of cargo on well-charted routes between civilized systems, the Ox-class is the backbone of many interstellar markets outside of the United Syndicates of Himeo. Repurposed Ox-class freighters are often used by pirates throughout the Spur thanks to their large size and ease of maintenance – and modification."
