Unlike its more successful competitors, it vests less of its space in its cargo capacity and more of its space in crew compartments - though, despite this, it remains quite cramped. This one appears to have been substantially modified, boasting a heavily armed gunnery pod slotted into its starboard cargo pod port, apparently feeding two moderately sized ballistic cannons. The hull also appears to have been strengthened, and the exterior has been painted a dull military green."

	<BR>Step one: Enable the connectors to cold loop pump and the cooling array to generator pump. This circulates the cold look through the turbine.<BR>\
	<BR>Step two: Set the gas mixer to output south, enable the pump, enable fuel injection. This will inject fuel mix into the chamber. \
	Feel free to put in as many canisters as you like, just make sure they're being mixed at a ratio of 60% oxidiser to 40% fuel. \
	The more burning mix you inject into there, the longer it'll last before you need to vent the inject more.<BR>\
	<BR>Step three: Disable injection on the fuel injection console. If you leave injection on, we'll have a bad time.<BR>\
	<BR>Step four: Ignition! Wait for the fire to fully burn out before proceeding to the next step. \
	If the glass makes a weird noise, that's normal.<BR>\
	<BR>Step five: After the fire has stopped, the contents of the chamber should be entirely carbon dioxidie. At this point, \
	enable circulation: 700L/s input and 1500kpa output should suffice. The higher you raise the output, \
	the more power it produces, but the quicker it cools.<BR>\
	<BR>If you get the feeling the glass will break, immediately vent the chamber and report to your commanding officer.</b></font>"
