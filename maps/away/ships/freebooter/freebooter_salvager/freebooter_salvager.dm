	<br><br>
	<h3>How does it work?</h3><hr>
	<br><br>
	This generator model has two circuits that receives the gas. As the gas flows, integrated turbine fans begin to spin and generate electricity. The principle behind this is
	that the greater the temperature difference between circuits is, the faster the fans will spin and subsequently the more energy is produced. Each time the gas flows through the circuits, the temperature difference
	(delta temperature) will decrease, this means in time the generator will produce less energy. The engine installed in your vessel has its hot loop on the port side and cold loop on
	the starboard side. If confused, the loops can be identified by determining which one is connected to the radiator array on your vessel's exterior.
	<br><br>
	<h3>Hot Loop</h3><hr>
	<br><br>
	Following is the steps of setting the hot flow successfully:
	<br><br>
	- Locate the gas mixer device in the aft-port side. Make sure it outputs the mixed gas to the west. Make sure that oxidizer (oxygen) and fuel (hydrogen) is connected to the relevant ports.
	The target ratio should be 60% oxidizer and 40% fuel. Turn on the mixer. <br><br>
	- Turn on the injection on the console (read the tag written on the console to identify it) in front of the combustion chamber. Make sure the fuel canister is spent and there's no residual burn mixture in
	the combustion chamber feed pipe. The recommended amount of fuels to inject is 2 canisters. Bear in mind the mixer will stop working if both inputs aren't receiving gas simultaneously. <br><br>
	- After the injection is complete, turn off the injection on the console. <b>Never start ignition sequence while injecting fuel into the chamber</b>. Hit the ignition button
	to start the combustion. <br><br>
	- After making sure that the combustion has finished, turn on the input in the console tagged 'Combustion Chamber Control' to maximum value and adjust the output rate to a value
	compensating power draw. The higher output rate the more power produced, at the cost of sustainability.
	<br><br>
	<h3>Cold Loop</h3><hr>
	<br><br>
	- Locate the pump tagged as 'Cold Loop Supply Pump' in the starboard side of the TEG. Turn it on at maximum transfer rate. <br><br>
	- (Optional) Add more gas to the cold loop by securing more canisters at the aft-starboard connectors. Do not overdo this. 1 or 2 more canisters is the ideal amount. <br><br>
	- Turn on the pump leading directly to the cold circuit, tagged as 'Cold Loop Flow Pump' and set the transfer rate to maximum.
	<br><br>
	<h3>Things to Note</h3><hr>
	<br><br>
	- If the combustion chamber cools below operational temperature, do <b>NOT</b> inject a new burn mixture until the chamber temperatures reaches below 400K. Otherwise the injected
	burn mix will ignite immediately on contact, preventing safe injection of the remaining mix. If it has to be replaced hastily, press the 'Emergency Chamber Vent' button to release
	combustion chamber contents. <br><br>
	- Any modifications to the setup made by parties other than Einstein Engines Inc. and its affiliates will void the warranty.
	<br><br>
	For the emergency procedures, see the next page."}
