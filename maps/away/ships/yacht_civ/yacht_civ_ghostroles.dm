		You are a member of crew on a private civilian yacht, owned by, and shared with three other people. \
		Perhaps you are friends or family, invested in some risky stocks or inherited all your assets, and want to to explore the stars together. \
		You are Solarian, but most of your life you have lived on some planet or moon - you are not a 'spacer', and life in space is mostly a new thing for you. \
		You are rich enough to afford a small yacht, to maintain it, and live in relative luxury, \
		and you are free to do anything you like, this is your vacation after all.\
