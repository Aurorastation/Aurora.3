As such, it has limited crew facilities and life support capabilities, and is instead reliant on its mothership for long-term operation. This ship is an interdiction variant, with its torpedo bay and railgun hardpoint replaced by a hangar and a boarding pod launch room, respectively."

Hephaestus Industries has attempted to sue the Elyran government many times for the navy's unlicensed production of its intellectual property, and Elyran courts have, unsurprisingly, always ruled in favor of the government - much to the frustration of the megacorporation, which has no other method of recourse. An inefficient design of ultra-light shuttle. Its only redeeming features are the extreme cheapness of the design and the ease of finding replacement parts. This one's transponder identifies it as an Elyran Naval Infantry recovery shuttle."
