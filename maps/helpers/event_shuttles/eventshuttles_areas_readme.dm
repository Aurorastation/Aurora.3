// This series of event shuttles should be used to replace the one we've been using for the last several events.
// Each one of the three is geared to have different levels of involvement of the crew. Mainly engineering and operations.
// All three ships will be given their own fluff written out, use as you wish.
// As for a technical explanation of each ship:
//
// Artemis is a combat focused spawn shuttle, made to address the issues we (the crew) had with the Konyang Warehouse Raid event.
// Its geared out for heavy security and crew militia use.
// There's also things like the machinists having all of their things packed up, ready to be moved out to somewhere off shuttle to handle IPC's
// While we're moving away from a militaristic setting at time of writing, this shuttle can still be very useful for events or noncannon events especially.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Apollo v1 is a humanitarian focused shuttle. It focuses on carrying service related supplies, operations supplies, and most importantly: scientific supplies.
// Additionally, engineering is issued RFD's to be able to build out as the mission requires.
// Only service, operations, and science would have to unload their gear.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Apollo v2 stays in line of the first Apollo, but it adds engineering to the list of departments that need to set up their gear outside.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Apollo v3 goes even further, packing up medical almost entirely. I very much like the idea of medical having to work with a handful of engineers to build a clinic, so this gives
// the option for an organizer to run with that.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Packrat is an ultra utilitarian approach, encouraging a non shuttle central event. Every job's gear is packed up in the smallest space possible.
// Its up to the crew as a whole to get all of this gear off the shuttle and deployed into an area
// I think this ship would be best served by existing in a city environment. Its shorter size narrative supports that, and its lack of internal walls for the cargo hold
// means that you cant really set up anyone's base of operations inside. At most, one department's worth of jobs.
// I strongly recommend using this ship in an urban environment where the crew has buildings around the ship they can move into.
