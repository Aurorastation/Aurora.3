/**
 *	Definitions for every area used on the SCCV Horizon map.
 *
 *	This file is only to contain definitions for the master horizon and horizon exterior areas, and this documentation.
 *	The other files in this subfolder ('maps/sccv_horizon/code/sccv_horizon_areas') are the remaining SCCV Horizon areas,
 *	divided broadly by department with the exception of horizon_areas_crew.dm.
 *
 *	While most should be self-explanatory by name, horizon_areas_crew is a catch-all file for all areas that are either 'public'
 *	(like hallways, washrooms) but also areas which are difficult to slot into a given department, like Head of Staff offices,
 *	non-dept storage, etc. If we add anything weird that doesn't fit neatly, add it there.
 *
 *	Whenever areas are added or removed from the Horizon, it should be handled within this subfolder. Whenever NBT comes, the
 *	definition names /area/horizon/. should just be replaced with /area/[whatever]/.
 *
 *	GUIDELINES:
 *	- The Horizon should not have any areas mapped to it which are defined outside this file.
 *	- Any PR that removes all areas of a given definition should also remove or comment out that definition from here.
 *	- No area should exist across multiple decks. Ex., an elevator vestibule on all three decks should have three
 *	child definitions, one for each deck. This is both for organization and for managing area objects like APCs etc.
 *	- Update the groupings list if anything is added/removed.
