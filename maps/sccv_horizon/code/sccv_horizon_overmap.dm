Designed to be an entirely self-sufficient general-purpose surveying ship and to carry multiple replacement crews simultaneously, the Venator is equipped with both a bluespace and a warp drive and two different engines. Defying typical cruiser dimensions, the Venator is home to a sizable residential deck below the operations deck of the ship, where the crew is housed. It also features weapon hardpoints in its prominent wing nacelles. This one’s transponder identifies it, obviously, as the SCCV Horizon."
