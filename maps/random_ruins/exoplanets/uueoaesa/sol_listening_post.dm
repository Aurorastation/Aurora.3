	A fucking miserable station on an equally miserable rock, watching some fucking lizards throwing nukes at each other and listening for... hell if I know. Making sure the Skrell or NT aren't up to something, \
	or that no pirates are trying to strike it rich out here. Six of us and a whole lot of fancy-ass equipment we're meant to keep running."

	to bring in some 'essential supplies'. Seems that pretty much all there is to do around here is drink, look at the consoles, and watch whatever dogshit movie someone has downloaded. Good news is that we can hear pretty much everything going on in this backwater, \
	bad news is that none of it's interesting. Lizards are still nuking each other, Skrell are doing some research on shit no one cares about over on Oueueue- the other fucking planet. The day the Alliance bails on this place is going to be the happiest day of my life."

	passing those off to the Navy proper to deal with. Not exactly riveting shit and serving my country or whatever but hey, something other than watching Stevens and Huang arm-wrestle for the eighteenth time this week, or counting the mold spots on the outer hull. God bless the fucking Alliance, ooh-rah.\
	Better get thanked for my goddamn service when I'm out of here."

	That's another planet here, and it's where most of the humans in the system are. The locals, who are these lizard people called Unathi, are having a war on their homeworld, but I hear that it's still safe on Ouerea. I really hope I get posted there, I want to meet \
	an alien! There are Skrell there too, and the LT says that we're meant to make sure they're not up to anything, but it just looks like they're doing a lot of complicated research stuff from what we see. Looking forward to calling you and Dad next time I get leave. Love, Johnny."
