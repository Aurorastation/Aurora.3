Checklist before you submit an issue! Feel free to partially or fully delete this in your eventual report.
* Do a quick key word search of the git for duplicate reports. If you find any, simply post a reply onto that issue instead!
* Please be specific in your description of the issue. Explain the desired result (what should be happening) and the actual result (what is happening). Simply stating that [something happens] is not very helpful at describing what's wrong.
* Have you tried reproducing the issue? If yes, steps to reproduce it would help immensely!
* All additional details help. Such as round ID, an admin you talked to if the issue required immediate fixing, etcetera, etcetera.
