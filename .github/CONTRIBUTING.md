# Coding Standards

### Absoloute Pathing
Absoloute pathing has to be used for type, proc, and verb definitions. This is to make searching and reading easier.

An example of properly pathed code:
```
/obj/item/device/cake
    [cake code here]

/obj/item/device/cake/proc/eat_cake()
    [proc code here]
```

An example of badly pathed code:
```
/obj/item/device/cake
    [cake code here]

    proc/eat_cake()
        [proc code here]
```

### qdel() and Destroy() usage
All objects with an applicable type need to be deleted by `qdel()`, as opposed to the regular `del()` proc. While conducting this action, make sure you remove all possible references to the object you assign for deletion *after* calling `qdel()`. This will enable the ProcessScheduler controller garbage collector to handle the objects assigned to it at its own pace, thus reducing lag in the long run.

An example of how to use `qdel()`:
```
/obj/item/plate
	var/obj/item/cake/cake

/obj/item/plate/New()
	cake = New()

// Eat the cake and destroy the cake object.
/obj/item/plate/proc/eat_cake()
	qdel(cake)	// Call qdel()
	cake = null	// Set local reference to null to assist the GC.
```

The `Destroy()` proc for objects should be defined, if there are any special operations that need to be conducted when an object is assigned for destruction with `qdel()`. Normally, it would set all object references that that specific item may contain to null, and destroy them as necessary. It is important to know that the best case scenario for the garbage collector is this: an object passed to it should not reference, or be referenced by any other ingame object.

Note that any modified `Destroy()` proc **must always return the original definition (`return ..()`) call!**

An example of how to define `Destroy()` for an item that needs it:
```
/obj/item/plate
	var/obj/item/cake/cake

/obj/item/plate/New()
	cake = New()

/obj/item/plate/Destroy()
	if (src.cake)	// We potentially have a reference.
		qdel(cake)	// Delete the referenced item -- this doesn't always have to be done.
		cake = null	// Set the pointer to null. This is the important bit.
					// All pointers that the plate item contains are now null. This will speed up the GC.

	return ..()		// Return the original definition of the proc.
```

`qdel()` is **not** capable of handling the following types of objects:
* file
* savefile
* SQLLite object
* Client object
* list objects.

You will have to use the regular `del()` proc to delete any object of that type.

### HTML styling for user output
All text output to the user, specially if the output operator `<<` is used, should be formatted in proper HTML. DM text macros for styling, such as `\red` and `\blue`, are no longer to be used actively. This will enable the modification of used HTML styling later down the line, via the centralized .css files. It will also enable a switch from an output panel, to other output methods.

For reference, here are the standard span classes for user output, and the correlation between them and the DM text macros:
* `<span class='danger'></span>` corresponds to `\red` and is bold.
* `<span class='warning'></span>` also corresponds to `\red` and is not bold.
* `<span class='notice'></span>` corresponds to `\blue` and is not bold.

There exist pre-processor macros for using these spans. `span(class, text)` which is the equivilant of typing a string that looks like this: `"<span class='[class]'>[text]</span>"`.

The stylesheet available for use within DM can be found in `code/stylesheet.dm`.

### Usage of forceMove
In order to make `Exited()` and `Entered()` procs more reliable, the usage of `forceMove()` when forcibly moving one item to another location, be it another item or turf, is required. Directly changing an item's loc values will skip over calls to the aforementioned procs, thus making them less useful and more unreliable.

An example of improper item moving:
```
/proc/some_proc(var/obj/A, var/obj/B)
	A.loc = B	// Simply move A inside B.
```

An example of proper item moving:
```
/proc/some_proc(var/obj/A, var/obj/B)
	A.forceMove(B)	// This will call A.loc.Exited() and B.Entered().
					// The first method does not call either of those.
```

### Database prefixing
All tables for the database should be prefixed according to the following list:
* `ss13_` for tables in which ingame data is held.
* `discord_` for tables in which BOREALIS data is held.

### Regarding the variable usr
`usr` should never be defined as a name for a custom variable. It is the name for a specific variable which exists for every proc, though it may not always have a value.

If at all possible, procs outside of verbs and `Topic()` should avoid reliance on `usr`, and instead use a custom argument to specify the user and its expected type. This makes it easier to reuse procs in chains where `usr` is not always defined.
