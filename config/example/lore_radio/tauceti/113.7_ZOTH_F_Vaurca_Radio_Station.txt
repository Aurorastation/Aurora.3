[RANDOMNOTE]/You are now listening to 113.7 ZOTH-FM. Broadcasting live from Belle Cote, reaching all the way to Vaur’s Tower in Caprice./[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]/The sound of a stainless steel guiro is mixed with a traditional Vaurca instrument and some rock motifs./[RANDOMNOTE]
Hey Brood Squad! It’s Anita Sinclair, back to blow your minds on Broodcast! Your absolute FAVE source for all the Vaurca hotness!  Today, we’re packing our bags and teleporting to the most oh-em-gee-worthy Vaurca destinations! Imagine the picture-perfect moments in Veii’ktown, the unreal energy of New Sedantis, and maybe even catching some gnarly waves in Diulszi! Think you know the Vaurcae? Nope—they’ve got the coolest places out there.  Buckle up, Brood Squad, this is about to get epic!
[RANDOMNOTE]/A male voice rapidly says, “Broodcast is an official transmission, certified by the Court of Queens order one-five-seven-dash-five. Broodcast is not affiliated to any Vaurca Hive and is financed by Vaurca Equality.”/[RANDOMNOTE]
Okay, Brood Squad, let’s ditch the formalities and get down to business! I’m holo-calling my bestie Natalie Lindquist, a freelance reporter who’s currently visiting Diulszi. I think only Natalie can do justice to the marvelous beaches of Diulszi while she’s standing there. 
[RANDOMNOTE]/A loud phone ringing./[RANDOMNOTE]
Hello, Anita?
Hi, Natalie! You’re live on Broodcast as we speak. I wanted to hear, straight out of your mouth, just how you’re feeling in Diulszi.
Well, Anita, I’m currently chilling under the sun with two leis on my neck, sipping a pina colada, all while a Bulwark in a floral shirt is fanning me with a huge leaf. Am I in heaven? Abso-lute-ly.
Natalie, you’re just making me so jealous now! Would you say hospitality has been totes on par with what you’d expect?
For sure! The Vaurcae are probably the most warm and welcoming species in the Spur. I almost feel like I’m one of their Queens with how well they’ve treated me! /(chuckles)/ I’m staying in this nice bungalow that’s completely run by Vytel Workers, the latest in eco-tourism too. Everything is sustainable and like, totally guilt-free! Makes me sad to even think about returning home after this holiday!
Well, Natalie, I think you haven’t told us the best part of your trip. Tell our listeners just how much your bungalow costs for the night, go on.
Okay! It costed me… 80 credits!
Gush! That REALLY does make me jealous. 80 credits for being treated like a queen? Sign me up! Okay, Natalie, I think that’ll be all today. Thank you so much for your time, bestie! Continue enjoying paradise, I send you all my love!
Bye, Anita! I’ll remember to bring you a souvenir!
[RANDOMNOTE]/The call cuts off./[RANDOMNOTE]
There you have it! If you’re ever thinking about leaving the system and visiting an exotic paradise, don’t hesitate and choose Diulszi! There’s just so much more that we didn’t even cover, like the nice surf communities the planet has. And the best? It’s all C’thur running the place! They really know how to make a resort. 
Before we continue, Brood Squad, we’ll play a song. This is New Gibson’s Njöva with her hit song, “Lovers Apart”!
[RANDOMNOTE]Orion’s belt, a map across your sky.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]My world spins in shadows, where constellations lie.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Cold vacuum whispers of the space between.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Yet my heart transmits a signal, unseen.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Meteor trails mark your flight.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Across the galaxy, a pixelated light.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]My pulse a whisper, your signal so strong.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Can this cosmic echo bridge where we belong?[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Your touch like stardust, a shimmer on my skin.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Your eyes, twin nebulae, pull my gravity in.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Skin like polished metal, circuits beneath.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Is this love, or a program I cannot delete?[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]/ZOTH! FM!…/ [RANDOMNOTE]
Wow. That song...deep stuff, right Brood Squad? Love across the cosmos—who knew, huh? And hey, speaking of deep dives, remember: you’re vibing along with me, Anita, right here on Broodcast, ZOTH FM! But enough with the feels—let’s get back to the Vaurca vibes! Because the next stop on our itinerary is Veiik’town!
Now, picture this: You land in Belle Cote, the amazing city I live in. But nestled right in the heart of the city is this incredible neighborhood called Veii’ktown. Think of it as, like, a Vaurca community—a place that’s bursting with Vaurca culture! But Veii’tkown isn’t just about history and tradition. This place is a HIVE of creativity!
So quick story: I wasn’t actually born in Belle Cote! Shocker, right? I’m a Greensville girl; you know, that small town /near/ Mendell? I came to Belle Cote about like… four-ish years ago? That’s about when Vaurcae were moving in! And let me tell you: from the start, their treatment was superb. I felt super welcomed by then. Flash forward a year later and guess what? Vaurcae are building this super-chic place called Veii’ktown. 
Now, let me tell you all about Veii’ktown. When you visit, you HAVE to try the fried k’ois fish. Don’t worry! They’re not really k’ois, or fish. They’re these tiny fried ice cream in the shape of a fish… colored yellow as well! They’re ultra cool and ULTRA delicious! They’re like my favorite treat whenever I visit, and I always love snapping pics of my food! You really have to try them, they’re that good!
They’ve also got these mega cute houses, modeled after what traditional Vaurca houses looked like! They’re like, really tiny, but also, REALLY adorable! I don’t even have words to describe them… they look like they have. Some of them are also like… these mega cool restaurants where you get to try what k’ois would taste like for humans and more. I’m telling you, if you want the FULL Vaurca experience, Veii’ktown is the best place for you to visit!
Now, before we take our amazing trip to New Sedantis, let’s hear another song. This one’s from Mictlani Cadu Silva, topping the techno-samba charts with his joy anthem, “Techno-samba is my freedom”!
[RANDOMNOTE]The rhythm calls, my spirit takes flight.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Neon city hums, dreams shimmer in the night.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Each step a pulse, can’t hold this feeling down.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Techno-samba surge, my soul breaks free of the ground![RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE]Techno-samba power, stardust in the endless night.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]No limits to this feeling, my heart transcends the strain.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Techno-samba is my freedom, where joy ignites again.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]The beat unites us, a symphony unbound.[RANDOMNOTE] 
[RANDOMNOTE]Strangers turn to kin, on this electric, spinning ground.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Worries fade to echoes, troubles drift away.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]This music is our haven, where spirits come to play.[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]This dance-a, speaks for me, where my spirit finds its light.[RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE]/A loud phone ringing./[RANDOMNOTE]
Heyy, Anita!
Hii, Mike! How’s New Sedantis treating you?
Well, you caught me with my mouth full. I’m enjoying a nice V’krexi Meat Special Burger from the new Up!Burger.
Woah, and like, what does it taste like? Is it AMAZING?
Amazing? You bet! Though it still falls short compared to the sights of the Ta’raii Square. It’s really something else to behold! You wouldn’t believe just how… cosmopolitan an underground city can feel like. It’s truly something unique.
Oh, Mike. Don’t tell me. Now you’re making me really envious!
Anita, but you haven’t heard the best. There are traditional Vaurca medicine centers here. They have workshops and, best of all, they even have a spa for humans! I feel like I have baby skin now. They’re just THAT good.
And how much did it cost you, Mike?
Well, Anita, that’s the good part! If you’ve made a donation to Vaurca Equality in the past, then you get one spa session for FREE!

Well, Anita, now that you ask… yes! You actually get a special discount in hotels here at New Sedantis. Also, Anita, did you know that if you have a Phoron-Star membership, you actually don’t have to pay for the trolley?
Woah, are you like, being serious now or just joking around?
