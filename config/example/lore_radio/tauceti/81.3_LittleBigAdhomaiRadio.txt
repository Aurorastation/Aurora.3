/(There's a sound of a mic shuffling.)/
Little Big Adhomai Radio., 81.3 FM.
Their host for tonight is his truly, Ramsho. Live to you from
He would call himself a DJ but he has no music to play, hahah!
Welcome listeners from District 6 and all across Mendell City. He hopes you are not tuning it at work. They don't like the truth.
Here, it is given raw. The true condition of life here in Little Adhomai. Life that shows how oppressed we are.
They say they are better than Sol, but he wonders if it is a big bar to clear. After all, no Tajara lives in Sol. One is better than zero, therefore they all brag about it.
Instead we are here. And guess what? The Republicans who swear fealty to Biesel and all those corporations get to live in the city proper. We are left in the shadows just because we disagree. So much for liberty.
They all rant and rave about equality, saying things like homosexuality are to be embraced. And yet you still have never heard of an M'sai or Zhan in a leadership position in this country. Ever.
Why? Republican propaganda telling the uneducated Humans and Skrell that a Zhan has a brain like a pea and is better suited for manual labor.
And what of M'sai? 'Violent hunters,' they say. 'They will rip your face off when you least expect it. Cannot be trusted'.
Meanwhile the /nobles/ and the commoners dominate the workplaces and get all the jobs. He thinks it is idiotic.
Nobody wants to hire this one because his fur is too dark and his build is too large.
They think he is a DPRA spy. He was born in Little Adhomai, and it is likely he will die here too.
So instead he makes money here telling these hundreds of thousands of listeners - he thanks you all, by the way - about the inequality and injustice our people face.
