Their host for tonight is his truly, Ramash. Joined by comrade Malzhna.
- [M.] From a damn scrrrapheap in Little Adhomai.

- [M.] She thinks this will turn deadly.
/(The noise of city streets fills the radio as several Tajara can be heard arguing wtih each other in Siik'maas.)/
/Can you hear him?/
- [R.] We can hear you, comrade. Are you safe?
/He is safe, yes, though not for long./
