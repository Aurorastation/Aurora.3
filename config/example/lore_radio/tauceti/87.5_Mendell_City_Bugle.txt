17 degrees and windy tonight as a night of heavy traffic brings closure to the city's bustle once more.
New this week, the SCC flagship Horizon arrives in Tau Ceti after a lengthy aid campaign to help the Coalition world of Konyang from the Rampancy crisis, a digital pandemic that infected millions of IPCs.
Thousands of Mendell residents with Konyang ancestry prepare to depart Biesel to say hello to friends and family from home after months of uncertainty.
The SCC says it plans to moor the Horizon for 'a week or two' before embarking on its mission to explore new frontiers.
Konyang was first affected by the Rampancy crisis in February, when alien transmissions invaded IPCs' minds and turned them feral and deadly.
These transmissions originated from the Hivebots, an extragalactic robotic faction with unknown, but hostile, intentions.
Following efforts by the government to quarantine them, a task force was assembled that included the Konyang military, Einstein Engines, the SCC, and an enigmatic ally of also-synthetic origin known as Purpose.
Just a few weeks ago, the crisis ended when a task force team, consisting of Konyang soldiers and crew from the Horizon, raided an enemy-controlled nuclear power plant and destroyed the source of the Rampancy crisis's transmissions.
Miraculously, no deaths from the task force were reported, and the signal was destroyed.
While the planet eases back into normalcy, though, they grapple now with the knowledge that hundreds were maimed and thousands of IPCs destroyed.
On the world of Konyang, every synthetic is free, and its inhabitants look to them as friends and family; friends and family lost in the pandemic.
The Coalition of Colonies is working to deliver aid to Konyang after the latter's government refused external help for months.
Stay tuned for more updates on Konyang and the aftermath of the crisis.

Residents of the Starlight Zone mourn the loss of Qzheni'eni Rulla, 203, a prominent Skrell political activist who campaigned for better living conditions of the Zone and its inhabitants.
Rulla, who campaigned against the Nralakk Federation's policies, rose to fame after giving a moving speech to the Zone's inhabitants in 2459.
The body is pending autopsy, as authorities from the Mendell City Police Department negotiate with the local Xii'Eyes neighborhood watch group for a handover of the body, one that is being met with friction from the locals.
In a statement, Rift Watcher Kalq'Qi Weibii, who is friends with Rulla, expressed sorrow and mourning, and wished for Skrell in Mendell City to undertake a moment of silence for them.
We will return to the news after these short messages.

The Mendell government has announced plans to construct a new metro line connecting District 1 with District 15, burrowing over 28 kilometers of new track underneath the surface.
The announcement comes after the Mendell City Council approved a transportation budget increase for 2466, following unprecedented levels of ridership pushing the city's public transport to its limits.
The mayor is expected to hold a groundbreaking ceremony next week, after which construction will begin immediately.
The announcement was praised by many, but was not without its share of criticism. Of particular contest is the route the tunnels take, which goes straight through District 9, in which many Vaurcae have dug out subterranean towns to dwell in.
It is estimated that the tunnel may displace a significant amount of these underground homes, a prospect which Vaurcae of District 9 are taking to the streets to protest.
Despite these, the city's progress on the line does not seem to be slowing down. Hephaestus Industries has said it will invest 155 million credits into tunnel construction as well as provide the materials needed.
The project is estimated to cost about 305 million credits total.

A warehouse has exploded in District 11, sending debris flying into the air and setting several nearby apartments on fire.
The warehouse on Ruhambe Street, owned by a storage subsidiary of Hephaestus Industries, was believed to have been holding volatile compounds used for a nearby construction project.
These compounds, for unknown reasons, detonated, causing a chain reaction that blew a hole in the roof and spread a fireball to nearby buildings.
The warehouse itself was almost completely destroyed. Fortunately, it happened after closing hours and nobody was inside. The warehouse's night security guards, who were on the perimeter, escaped safely and were unharmed.
As of tonight, the Fire Department has rescued over 300 individuals from their homes, over half of which have injuries such as smoke inhalation or burns. They are being treated at nearby hospitals.
However, at least 100 remain unaccounted for, and tragically at least 4 have died from fire-related injuries so far.
The District struggles with fire protection as buildings go unmaintained and out-of-date; they are typically unable to pay for the refits required to be up to fire code standards.
Hephaestus is cooperating with authorities to determine the cause of the explosion as well as if any negligence was involved.
The company is also sending an inspection team to analyze any structural damages to nearby buildings caused by the fire.
We will update you if any further developments occur with this story.

More news from Konyang for this evening. The Tau Ceti-Konyang bluespace gate, which the SCCV Horizon has went through earlier, has been repaired. Traffic may now flow freely between the two systems.
The Republic of Biesel has stated it intends to use the gate to send 5 billion credits of relief goods and services to the devastated world, marking the latest in foreign aid packages being sent.
Meanwhile, the Konyang government plans to reopen tourist visas to travelers by mid-May.
Experts say that while Konyang is being swiftly rebuilt, it will take years to fully recover from the damage caused and an indeterminate amount of time to heal the mental wounds its citizens have suffered.
The crisis has caused an approximately 906 billion credits worth of damage worldwide, both from destroyed IPC frames as well as damage to property, such as vehicles.
Unfortunately, with news of the Rampancy outbreak comes a fresh uptake in anti-synthetic discrimination and violence. Employers are struggling to keep their synthetic employees safe in less-affluent areas of Mendell.
The attackers commonly state to sympathize with Nralakk or Dominian media, citing the Rampancy crisis as 'vindication' for the beliefs they have held for so long.
One of these attacks resulted in the death of an IPC, Miamos-3, who succumbed to damage after being jumped in an alley.
The attackers, a Skrell, a Tajara and two Humans, all Mendell natives, were subdued by Idris security personnel from a nearby bank and handed over to police.
Unfortunately, when said security team checked on Miamos, they found that their positronic was damaged beyond repair.
When asked about it, the Empire of Dominia denied supporting any of these attackers and denounced them as 'uncivilized barbarians'.
The Nralakk Federation has done the same, stating that 'violence is not the answer for these kinds of situations'.
Nralakk and Dominia both have sustained societal trauma relating to past catastrophes in which synthetics or artificial intelligence played a major role.
The MCPD has stated it will increase foot patrols in the coming days in response to the uptick in attacks. Several security and PMC companies are also announcing tightened security for their clients and venues.
Synthetics, especially free ones, are advised to take caution when visiting the less-trafficked areas of the city and, if they have to, to go with someone trusted.
