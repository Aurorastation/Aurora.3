87.5, Mendell City Bugle FM. Bringing you the latest news, 24/7, wherever you are in Tau Ceti.
17 degrees and windy tonight as a night of heavy traffic brings closure to the city's bustle once more.
New this week, the SCC flagship Horizon arrives in Tau Ceti after a lengthy aid campaign to help the Coalition world of Konyang from the Rampancy crisis, a digital pandemic that infected millions of IPCs.
Thousands of Mendell residents with Konyang ancestry prepare to depart Biesel to say hello to friends and family from home after months of uncertainty.
The SCC says it plans to moor the Horizon for 'a week or two' before embarking on its mission to explore new frontiers.
Konyang was first affected by the Rampancy crisis in February, when alien transmissions invaded IPCs' minds and turned them feral and deadly.
These transmissions originated from the Hivebots, an extragalactic robotic faction with unknown, but hostile, intentions.
Following efforts by the government to quarantine them, a task force was assembled that included the Konyang military, Einstein Engines, the SCC, and an enigmatic ally of also-synthetic origin known as Purpose.
Just a few weeks ago, the crisis ended when a task force team, consisting of Konyang soldiers and crew from the Horizon, raided an enemy-controlled nuclear power plant and destroyed the source of the Rampancy crisis's transmissions.
Miraculously, no deaths from the task force were reported, and the signal was destroyed.
While the planet eases back into normalcy, though, they grapple now with the knowledge that hundreds were maimed and thousands of IPCs destroyed.
On the world of Konyang, every synthetic is free, and its inhabitants look to them as friends and family; friends and family lost in the pandemic.
The Coalition of Colonies is working to deliver aid to Konyang after the latter's government refused external help for months.
Stay tuned for more updates on Konyang and the aftermath of the crisis.

Residents of the Starlight Zone mourn the loss of Qzheni'eni Rulla, 203, a prominent Skrell political activist who campaigned for better living conditions of the Zone and its inhabitants.
Rulla, who campaigned against the Nralakk Federation's policies, rose to fame after giving a moving speech to the Zone's inhabitants in 2459.
The body is pending autopsy, as authorities from the Mendell City Police Department negotiate with the local Xii'Eyes neighborhood watch group for a handover of the body, one that is being met with friction from the locals.
In a statement, Rift Watcher Kalq'Qi Weibii, who is friends with Rulla, expressed sorrow and mourning, and wished for Skrell in Mendell City to undertake a moment of silence for them.
We will return to the news after these short messages.

The Mendell government has announced plans to construct a new metro line connecting District 1 with District 15, burrowing over 28 kilometers of new track underneath the surface.
The announcement comes after the Mendell City Council approved a transportation budget increase for 2466, following unprecedented levels of ridership pushing the city's public transport to its limits.
The mayor is expected to hold a groundbreaking ceremony next week, after which construction will begin immediately.
The announcement was praised by many, but was not without its share of criticism. Of particular contest is the route the tunnels take, which goes straight through District 9, in which many Vaurcae have dug out subterranean towns to dwell in.
It is estimated that the tunnel may displace a significant amount of these underground homes, a prospect which Vaurcae of District 9 are taking to the streets to protest.
Despite these, the city's progress on the line does not seem to be slowing down. Hephaestus Industries has said it will invest 155 million credits into tunnel construction as well as provide the materials needed.
The project is estimated to cost about 305 million credits total.

87.5, Mendell City Bugle FM. Bringing you the latest news, 24/7, wherever you are in Tau Ceti.
Following a police shootout, Jaxa, a runaway Shell IPC who fled from her owner in Xanu Prime, was shot and killed by police. She was wanted for identity theft, fraud, and two counts of attempted murder.
Jaxa, who was living in District 15 under the alias Jacquelyn Walker, was on the run after fleeing her position as a bartender in the extremely prestigious Sultana Rex Hotel after an outburst that nearly resulted in the deaths of two employees.
Sultana Rex placed a 1 million credit bounty on any information regarding her whereabouts last month. Two days ago, an anonymous tip led the hotel to call the MCPD, leading to the raid.
An MCPD spokesperson said in a conference that Jaxa was armed with a smuggled pistol, and briefly exchanged fire with police before being killed.
Sultana Rex has stated it aims to step up security measures following the incident.
The news is the latest in a string of recent runaway Shell discoveries as their former employers issue handsome bounties to discover their whereabouts.
Biesel border control says it plans to enact stricter measures to check incoming visitors and immigrants at the checkpoints.
