- Goooood evening Mendell City and welcome to Hi-Fi Sports, bringing the latest matches from the city to the galaxy live... Over! The! Air!
I'm Jake, and together with my cohost Rob we're gonna be bringing you the play-by-play tonight from the gridiron football game here at the Trasen Arena!
Tonight we got the Mendell Mavericks facing off against the Belle Cote Badgers in the planetary qualifier for the Orion Cup this coming June. It's one hell of a match.
- That's right, Jake, winner tonight'll be representing the whole of Biesel for the Orion Cup, isn't that wild.
- Oh, I bet it is, Rob, we've got high stakes. Tell us about our city's visitors tonight.
- The Badgers hailing from Belle Cote in their red-and-silver jerseys are a hell of a sight to see on the world stage.
They're the underdogs, Jake, and recently've attracted worlds of attention when they /smashed/ the Cape City Mavericks in their last qualifier match three weeks ago against all odds - and almost all bets.
Cheers are high here as people from all over Tau Ceti come to root 'em on. Their coach says recent weeks've been higher for them than ever.
And it seems the businesses are taking notice, too. Zavodskoi Interstellar's sponsoring these folks tonight.
- Really now? I guess they'll be packing some extra guns tonight, hah!
/(The crowd roars.)/
- Can you hear the high /voltage/ soaring through the crowd tonight? There's gonna be nothing short of monstrous cries from this crowd, betting that now.
- Yup. And what of the home team, Jake?
- Well, Rob, the Mavericks need no introduction, now, do they? Two-time Orion Cup winner, and an absolute juggernaut on this side of the galaxy when it comes to gridiron.
Leading their ranks is QB Mike Halente, local hero, born in New Gibson before moving to Mendell as a kid. Bets are high on him tonight.
- Oh, I bet we'll know it when we hear it, he /is/ the safe one after all, huh?
- Damn right. But I think what's gonna really make the difference here's the other rising star, the Badgers' half back, Jek 'JM' Mruzarzhir!
- That's right, Mendell, we've got Tajara in the gridiron celebrity ranks now! Jek's a star, let me tell you that. Runs like a lightning bolt and can take a hit like nobody else could.
- Let's see if that holds up tonight, Rob. We're close to starting now. Stands are packed, teams are lining up on the grass now.
Any second now!
/(The sound of a whistle blows.)/
- And they're off! If you're new to gridiron, ladies and gentlemen, every game starts with the kickoff. Every second counts.
The Mavericks kick to the Badgers, and the game is underway.
The Badgers' return man catches it at the 5-yard line and makes a strong run... but heâ€™s brought down at the 25!
The Badgers are starting with possession, and it's going to be interesting to see how they handle the Mavericks' /formidable/ defense.
Watch as the Badgers' QB, Javier Reyes, with a steely determination in his eyes, lines up under center.
He takes the snap, drops back, and he's looking downfield - and launches a /deep/ pass!
- Oh, but he's intercepted by the Mavericks' cornerback Rayan Mansour! (/The crowd gasps./)
Mansour makes a break down the sideline - dodging tackles /left and right/, look at this! -
And is finally brought down well within the Badger's 20-yard line. What a turn!
/(Cheering can be heard in the distance.)/
- The Mavericks have a golden opportunity here, everyone. Mavericks QB Mike Halente's in the shotgun now.
And he takes the snap to open. He fakes a handoff, rolls to his right -
And he runs, runs like hell! But look at the missile coming in, ready to strike him in the side!
- But not before he launches a pass at receiver Nruka Zhumalli!
- Who catches it at the 30 yard line and starts bolting!
They're trying to catch him!
- But it's hopeless as he goes /into the end zone!/
*TOUUUUCHDOOOOWN MAVERICKS!!*
/(Roars of cheering can be heard in the distance.)/
/('Mavericks! Mavericks! Mavericks!')/
- Look at the crowd cheer for the home team! Like music to my ears.
- What a powerful first strike! Mavericks score first blood and put points on the board early this first quarter.
- Game's far from decided, yet, though, Rob, look at the Badgers. They're a-rearing. They're here to /win/.
- You're right, look at them, they're steeled! Completely undeterred and ready to strike again.
- And here we go, the Mavericks are setting up for the kickoff, the energy in the stadium is electric, fans are on the edge of their seats.
/(The sound of a whistle blows.)/
The ball sails /high/ into the air, and we're back in action!
The Badgers' return man catches it at the 10 this time, weaving through the Mavericks' special teams, and he's making a solid run!
But he's brought down just past the 40! A good start for the Badgers.
/(Moderate applause sounds from the audience.)/
- Reyes, after that earlier interception, looks absolutely determined to make amends. He's back under center now.
Reyes takes the snap, hands it off to running back Leon Grant, who finds a gap and /charges/ through the Mavericks' defense for a good 8-yard gain!
Next play now, Reyes is back in the pocket. He's got that look in his eye, the kind of focus you see in a player who's about to do something *big*.
He scans the field, launches another deep pass! This time connecting /clean/ with wide receiver Michael Torrence, who's got a step up on his defender.
Torrence *hauls* it in at the 30 and is tackled down at the Mavericks' 22-yard line. The Badgers are answering back with vigor.
- The crowd's making all sorts'a faces, now. Anxiety, excitement, hard to read with how much they're /shaking!/
The Badgers are pressing, the Mavericks' defense is bracing for impact. Reyes, with confidence restored, lines up for the next snap.
And he takes it and drops back, quick pass to the side to Torrence, who dodges one, dodges /two/ Mavericks defenders...
Ouh! And he's /pushed out of bounds/ close to the 10-yard line! The Badgers are knocking on the door now!
- You can taste the intensity here now. Mavericks scored the first TD in a blitz, but if you ask me this one looks just about ready to be another one! And much more hard-earned at that too.
Reyes, under center, calls an audible, seeing something in the Mavericks' setup.
- Wonder what he's thinking!
He takes the snap, a quick handoff to Grant, who barrels through the middle!
And is he making it to the endzone?
- He is! Look at this--
*TOUCHDOOOOWWN BADGERS!!*
/(Roars of cheering can be heard in the distance.)/
/('Baaadgeeeeeerrrs! Baaadgeeeeeerrrs!')/
- The stadium *explodes* with noise, the Badgers fans erupting in jubilation as their team evens the score!
Six on six now, dead-even. What an incredible show so far.
- That's right, this game's gonna be a classic for the books, let me tell you that.
The Mavericks gather, regrouping after the Badgers' score. They're a team known for their resilience, after all.
The kickoff return team lines up, the Badgers' kicker readies, and the ball is back in the air!
Caught at the 15 by the Mavericks' return man Josh Kaczynski, who takes off, cutting through the Badgers' coverage team like a hot knife through butter, he's past the 30, the 40, midfield, only the kicker to beat...
- And Kaczynski sidesteps him! He could go all the way...
- No, he's tackled from behind, but not before he gets to the Badgers' 35-yard line. What a return! (/The crowd cheers./)
The Mavericks are in prime position to strike back.
What a game we've got on our hands!
- Both teams are not giving an inch, fighting for every yard.
The Mavericks are lining up, electrified. Halente, calm and collected, is having a look around the field. He gets in the shotgun, takes the snap.
A quick look, his gaze lands on Zhumalli, and throws a short pass!
Zhumalli catches it effortlessly, and immediately after survives a tackling attempt!
And he starts running to make a landmark first down.
- Mavericks aren't wasting any momentum here at all. Halente's once again in the shotgun ready to drive this offensive streak home. He lines up for the snap.
He takes it, pumps a fake to his left, and then shifts direction running up the right of the field!
- Is he trying to drive it home himself?!
- He is, look, he's keeping!
As he sliiiides down /just/ short of the end zone!
- First and goal now, right on the verge of coming on top again. Halente's under center this time.
He takes the snap and runs for powerhouse running back Jookwan Moon, who charges towards the line!
But wait! The Badgers' legendary defense kicks in last minute!
And a slam-down, like something out of a wrestling match! Moon's stopped dead in his tracks, no gain made. (/The crowd groans./)
- What a stand! You think this is pure adrenaline at this point?
- No doubt about it. We're entering second and goal now. Mavericks are looking to regroup after that /stout/ defense by the Badgers. Halente lines up for one more gambit, he's in the shotgun again, looks to his left.
And he goes for a quick slant to Zhumalli, but it fails! Up like a brick wall comes Fred Knudsen, making the ball hit the ground! And it's dead.
Here we are now, third and goal, Mavericks really wanting to punch it in at this point.
Halente, with a quick glance to the sideline for the play, nods, understanding the gravity of this moment. The snap, a quick drop back, he's pressured - escapes a sack, rolls out, and he's looking for the end zone, he throws on the run--
*And he's intercepted!* (/The crowd erupts into chaotic screams./)
Pit-manuevered by the Badgers' linebacker, Theo Patterson, in the end zone! Patterson with a /game-changing/ play, robbing the Mavericks of a score and giving the Badgers a crucial turnover.
- Folks, if you're just tuning in, you've missed what could only be described as a rollercoaster of emotions.
The Badgers' defense, bending but not breaking, has just turned the tables on the Mavericks with an interception right in the end zone on the fourth down.
With the ball now in their hands, the Badgers are looking to capitalize on that monumental defensive play.
Reyes, calm and composed despite the high stakes, leads his team out. They start from their own 20-yard line after the touchback.
Reyes in the shotgun, takes the snap, does a /quick/ handoff to Leon Grant. He finds a seam and breaks free for a massive gain, all the way to their 45-yard line!
- Strategy here's clear, folks - run the clock down and buy time. But I'd be wrong if I were to assume they weren't going for another T-D.
Reyes, back in control, showing why he's the leader of this team. A quick handoff to Grant, and look at him go, /slicing/ through the Mavericks' defense.
- They've got less than two minutes on the clock, Rob. It's now or never if they want to take the lead into halftime.
And Jake, let's not forget, these moments are where heroes are made. Reyes, under pressure, has been cool as the other side of the pillow.
But the Mavericks' defense, see, they're no pushovers! They've been bending but not breaking, ready to /stand their ground!/
Badgers're making a couple'a quick plays here, trying to find an opening, but looks like none of their throws are breaking the citadel that is the Mavericks' defense so far! Time's a-ticking.
You can see them hesitate for a second here, Rob. But look! Hand signal. You know what that means.
- That's right, ladies and gentlemen, they're going for a field goal with a minute on the clock.
They're ready to launch a kick on the field now, fellas. /(The crowd practically falls silent in anticipation.)/
They take the snap! And the hold... and it soars!
*And it makes it into a field goal!* Three point lead on the Badgers as we make it right into halftime!
/(Chaotic cheers emerge.)/
That's the end of the first half here at the Trasen Arena, with the Belle Cote Badgers leading the Mendell Mavericks 9 to 6.
It's been a tightly contested game, Rob, full of twists and turns.
- Absolutely, Jake. Both teams have had their moments, and it's all been about capitalizing on those opportunities.
The Badgers' defense, especially, coming up big with that end zone interception.
But don't count the Mavericks out; history shows they shine like /supernovae/ in the second half.
- Right you are, Rob. Can't wait to see what they cook up!
- And now, as the teams head into the locker room, it's all about adjustments. What can the Mavericks do to break through that tough Badger defense?
And can the Badgers keep up the momentum and pull off this upset?
