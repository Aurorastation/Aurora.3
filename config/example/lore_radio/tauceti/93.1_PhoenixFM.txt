This is 93.1 Phoenix FM, live to you today, Mendell City!

/(The cry of a phoenix.)/
Gooood evening to all you wonderful people in the Capital of the Cosmos!
I'm DJ Neller, bringing you all the best easy tunes on this side of the Spur, right here, on Phoenix FM.
I bet we're all a bit exhausted from the heavy traffic tonight, eh? So many people these days. My grandfather told me he remembered when our city had only ten million!
Hah. Feels like yesterday, he says. I wish it were, grandpa, the commute would be just a little more bearable.
But enough reminiscing, let's get on with a relaxing beat. Hopefully it might massage your ears a little. This is Waves, by MariMari.
[RANDOMNOTE] Down the street where the lights run low, there's an evening show, /(In the usual flow),/ [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Singing stories, singing lies, under cloudy night skies, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /(Hearts are wandering, wondering),/ [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Of eras going by. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] What's life? If not for the songs that we sing and make in every single day, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Of laughs, loves and cries, and of music that never dies..... [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Oh we dance and sway to the rhythm of the waves, it ebbs and flows, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] And we dance and sway to the rhythm of the waves like no one's ever known, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] And the show's still live, there's a wonderful vibe, as the band bows out [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] As the curtains come down and the moon, it comes out. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /A brief instrumental before the song ends./ [RANDOMNOTE]
Never fails to make you think, does it? We make songs throughout or lives.
As a songwriter myself, this rings to me. We can turn our greatest pain into our greatest songs.
Anyway, let's not dilly-dally.
We'll be back... after these short messages. Stay tuned for some more hits!

[RANDOMNOTE] Out on the open road, where the sky touches the ground, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] There's a story untold, and it's waiting to be found. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] With the windows down, and the breeze in our hair, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] We're chasing horizons, without a single care! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Through the valleys and over the hills, we roam, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] With the rhythm of the engine, feeling just like home. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The sun sets ahead! In a blaze of gold, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] In these moments, we all hold stories untold. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Chasing horizons, in the light of the day, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Finding freedom in our own way. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] With every mile, a new song to sing, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Underneath our wings, feeling like a King! [RANDOMNOTE]

Anyway. That was Open Horizons, by Lex Santoro. Speaking of Lex, actually, here he is right now! As our special guest of the hour, exclusively on Phoenix FM.
Wasn't that a smooth segue? Thanks for coming, Lex. Welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me, Nel. Good to be here.
Lex, Open Horizons has hit #1 on Trending this week on NanoTunes. You've managed to dethrone the previous 1st place within just 3 weeks of your song releasing. What's it feel like?
I don't know how to describe it to you, Nel, I just feel like I'm on the clouds.
Feeling like a king?
Hah! Yeah, feeling like a king. I'm just glad my career finally paid off.
Oh yeah? Do tell.
This is like my eighteenth song now. A lot of people don't seem to know that. Most of them were failures.
Oh. Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, but to be honest with you, I don't know what made this one so special to people.
Maybe it's just that good in a way you don't realize.
Heh, maybe. Least the other songs are beginning to pick up steam now.
What do you plan to do now?
Well, standard answer's a tour. My manager's already working on booking some venues.
Can ya get me a ticket? /(He laughs.)/
Hehe, no promises, man, but I'll put in a good word for you.
Counting on it! Thanks for coming.
Thank you too, Nel.
We'll be back after these messages.
