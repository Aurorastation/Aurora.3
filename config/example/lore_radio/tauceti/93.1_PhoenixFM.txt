/(The cry of a phoenix.)/
Gooood evening to all you wonderful people in the Capital of the Cosmos!
I'm DJ Neller, bringing you all the best easy tunes on this side of the Spur, right here, on Phoenix FM.
I bet we're all a bit exhausted from the heavy traffic tonight, eh? So many people these days. My grandfather told me he remembered when our city had only ten million!
Hah. Feels like yesterday, he says. I wish it were, grandpa, the commute would be just a little more bearable.
But enough reminiscing, let's get on with a relaxing beat. Hopefully it might massage your ears a little. This is Waves, by MariMari.
[RANDOMNOTE] Down the street where the lights run low, there's an evening show, /(In the usual flow),/ [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Singing stories, singing lies, under cloudy night skies, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /(Hearts are wandering, wondering),/ [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Of eras going by. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] What's life? If not for the songs that we sing and make in every single day, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Of laughs, loves and cries, and of music that never dies..... [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Oh we dance and sway to the rhythm of the waves, it ebbs and flows, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] And we dance and sway to the rhythm of the waves like no one's ever known, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] And the show's still live, there's a wonderful vibe, as the band bows out [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] As the curtains come down and the moon, it comes out. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] /A brief instrumental before the song ends./ [RANDOMNOTE]
Never fails to make you think, does it? We make songs throughout or lives.
As a songwriter myself, this rings to me. We can turn our greatest pain into our greatest songs.
Anyway, let's not dilly-dally.
We'll be back... after these short messages. Stay tuned for some more hits!

Anyway. That was Open Horizons, by Lex Santoro. Speaking of Lex, actually, here he is right now! As our special guest of the hour, exclusively on Phoenix FM.
Wasn't that a smooth segue? Thanks for coming, Lex. Welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me, Nel. Good to be here.
Lex, Open Horizons has hit #1 on Trending this week on NanoTunes. You've managed to dethrone the previous 1st place within just 3 weeks of your song releasing. What's it feel like?
I don't know how to describe it to you, Nel, I just feel like I'm on the clouds.
Feeling like a king?
Hah! Yeah, feeling like a king. I'm just glad my career finally paid off.
Oh yeah? Do tell.
This is like my eighteenth song now. A lot of people don't seem to know that. Most of them were failures.
Oh. Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, but to be honest with you, I don't know what made this one so special to people.
Maybe it's just that good in a way you don't realize.
Heh, maybe. Least the other songs are beginning to pick up steam now.
What do you plan to do now?
Well, standard answer's a tour. My manager's already working on booking some venues.
Can ya get me a ticket? /(He laughs.)/
Hehe, no promises, man, but I'll put in a good word for you.
Counting on it! Thanks for coming.
Thank you too, Nel.
We'll be back after these messages.

Didja like that? It's variety hour here, and no century is safe from this show, not even classical.
That was Rockin' Robin covered by Rodrigo Siesente of Mictlan. Originally sung by Bobby Day, circahooh. /1958./ Don't even think any /Skrell/ from then are alive today. If you are, though, hello! Welcome to the channel.
Fun fact about this one: the folks who wrote the song never got to renew the copyright, and the song lyrics became public domain.
So it became a real popular tune for indie artists to cover, huh! Even 'till today, over /half a millennium/ later.
Goes to show you just can't beat the classics sometimes. Think this is where the term 'grandfathering' really came from, huh? Haha!
We'll be back after these messages.

Welcome back, you rising birds. This is DJ Neller again, back at you again for some tunes and talks.
I'm here now today with a special guest. You might know her from her hit cooking show on the holo. Over 10 million subscribers, can you believe it? It's insane.
That's right, it's Akane Nakegawa, better known as Akaga. Thanks for being here, Akane.
Thanks for having me!
Now, Akane, everyone's been abuzz about your unique approach to fusion cuisine. Somehow you've managed to blend Konyang and Biesel cuisine so excellently together it's almost as if you're making a whole new genre out of it.
It's really all about the stories, Nel. Every dish has a story - growing up in Suwon I was absolutely surrounded by such rich history of Konyang cuisine. It's already a fusion in itself - Korean and Japanese cuisine from Earth.
And I really think that taking that history and adding international flair to it would let me tell a whole new story with the food and all.
Interesting. Speaking of stories, your show has featured some incredible guest chefs. Do you have a favorite episode or a favorite guest that stands out?
Oh, that’s a tough one! But if I had to choose, I’d say the episode with Chef Lola from Vysoka was a standout. She brought such vibrant energy and taught us all about the native spices. We made this yam and peanut stew that just blew me away.
Ooh, I have to try that sometime. Now, with over 10 million subscribers watching your culinary adventures, what do you think draws people to your show?
I think it’s the blend of education and entertainment. We’re not just cooking; we’re exploring cultures, diving into the history behind the dishes while keeping things light and fun. People enjoy learning about the world from their kitchens.
Oh, yeah, absolutely - and it's always a joy to watch. Let’s switch gears a little. I’ve heard you’re also a big music fan. How does music influence your cooking?
Music is a big part of my cooking! I think it sets the mood for me and gets me into a rhythm. I'm a sucker for tunes from home, but sometimes I might go with samba or something really groovy and dancey to get me pumped up.
I love that! Maybe you can give us some recommendations to play here on Phoenix, haha.
Yeah, maybe! I can give you a list afterward.
Now, can you give our listeners a sneak peek into what’s coming up next on your show?
Definitely! We’re planning a series exploring ancient cuisines. Think, dishes that were served in the royal courts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
We’re going to recreate these recipes with modern twists, you know? Add some new spices, techniques, bring old food to new tables.
That sounds absolutely incredible, Akane. We can't wait to see it. Thanks for dropping by and sharing your culinary world with us.
Thanks for having me, DJ Neller. It’s been a pleasure!
Alright, you rising birds, stay tuned. We've got some fresh beats coming up next, followed by more of your favorite late-night chit-chat. Don’t go anywhere!
