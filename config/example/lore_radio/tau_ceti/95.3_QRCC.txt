/You’re listening to 95.3 QRCC, Quirk!/
/Mendell’s hit station– with Jamie, Morena, and Liam!/
Gooood afternoon, Mendell City! I’m Jamie–
I’m Morena!
And I’m Liam. 
Oh man, you guys are not gonna believe what happened on the way to work today.
What’s that?
I was buying a wrap at Quik-E-Burger, right…
Hold on, they have wraps now?!
Yeah, but that’s not the point–
What kind of wrap?
…Crispy chicken, but I was saying–
Liam, it’s your turn to buy lunch this week, we’re getting Quik-E wraps.
It was my turn last week, too…
Anyway, I was getting my wrap, and I walked out of the restaurant…
Right, right.
And there was a Venom Mandible there, spinning off my hubcaps!
What?
Come on, next you’re gonna blame a Raskaran for chipping your paintjob.
Ahaha! We’re gonna get some tunes rolling right away.
This is “Within, Without” by the Red Lines!

[RANDOMNOTE] Within, without [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Is that just the breaks? [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Within, without [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’m falling out of place [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Within, without [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’m lost without a trace [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Within, without [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Can’t find another way [RANDOMNOTE]

Welcome back to Quirk, I’m Jamie.
That was “Believe!~ (In the time)” by GUMI. I heard they’re coming out with a new spinoff this year!
But let’s be honest, it’s probably gonna be, uh…
Anyway. Coming up, number three on our top ten! This is “Love Angel” by INTERSTELLAR GIRLS.
[RANDOMNOTE] Heart beat, heart beat [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] My heart sings only for you [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Lover, lover [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] My love is only for you [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] When you see me, flying high [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’ll sing only for you, all the time [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Don’t you think of anyone but me [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Because I’ll see, I’ll see [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Would you make me sad? [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To throw away my love like that? [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Don’t go, don’t go [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Baby, I’ll know [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] And you’ll never need anyone again! [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Heart beat, heart beat [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] My heart sings only for you [RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE] My love is only for you [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] When you see me, flying high [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’ll sing only for you, all the time [RANDOMNOTE]
/95.3, Quirk Ra-di-ohhhh…/
[RANDOMNOTE] On that stage, under the light, I feel so unreal [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] When I think and when I feel [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Beyond my gilded cage, break from my reality [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I can’t believe I’m in this role, I don’t think I can act [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] With insufficient tact [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Putting up so many walls to keep myself intact [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Living in the spotlight, ah-ah [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] A dream I always dreamed [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] I’ll put aside my alienation [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Play to all the fascination [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The real relation [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The underlying dream [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] All the world's indeed a stage, and we are merely players [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Actor, singer, dancer, portrayer [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Everyone is my audience, just like I’m their own [RANDOMNOTE]
Aaaaand we’re back! Guess what time it is, gang!
