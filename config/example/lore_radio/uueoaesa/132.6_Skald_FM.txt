[RANDOMNOTE] Come gather me lads, I'll weave ye a tale, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Of a captain unrivalled, who men called Smokescale. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The first and the greatest, ol' Smokescale flew, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] In a ship called Glorywright, e'er strong and true. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Ouerea to Xanu, Biesel to Sol, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] There weren't a place Glorywright didn't know. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] When men saw her coming, they bared blades and cried, [RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE] But even ol' Smokescale, he were but a man, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] When he wagered it all on a perilous plan. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] He flew far to Sol, in the old Middle Ring, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] To take enough phoron for the richest of kings. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] The corporates chased him, but none could prevail, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] For no man could best the rogue called Smokescale. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Now some say he died there, by the Crimson Moon, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] That he grasped for too much and did seal his doom, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] But listen, me lad, for I tell ye no lies, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] For they ne'er found the treasure, out in empty skies. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] So come now me hearties, the tale is done, [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Of the man who struck out to seek glory and won. [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] But that treasure's still out there, out in the deep black [RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE] Many men have gone searching, and not one did come back. [RANDOMNOTE]
