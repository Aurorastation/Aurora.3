Hello and welcome everyone to Frank Conversations, this is your host Woo-Chung.
Today we will be taking calls from our audience, on the subject of the outbreak.
/Phone dial tone.../
Hello? Can you hear us?
/Yes? Hello./
Hi, welcome on air. Do you have a story you would wish to share?
/Yes, actually.. I was wondering if anyone has seen my friend? IPC, about two meters tall, industrial./
What is your friend's name?
/He always called himself Daehak. He disappeared last week-/
Where did they disappear from?
/Saitama island, he works at the dam there, they don't know where he went after the shift./
It seems time's up for this call. I'm certain all PBA listeners will do our best.
If anyone knows anything, please contact the police, or this station directly.
Let's move to our next caller.
/Phone dial tone.../
Hello? You are on air.
/Hi, PBA?/
Yes indeed, you are on air.
/Great. Do you guys have any idea how I am supposed to go to work?/
What is the problem?
/Hhhkhhh-.../
/The quarantine is the problem. I have to commute an hour to go to work. And now even that is impossible./
Are you calling from Suwon? They are telling me there should be designated lanes where traffic is allowed.
/Yeah, but they are all clogged up. And my boss won't let us work from home./
They might have to. All major non-retail businesses must have that option.
/I don't get it, I'm not even an IPC, why can't they make a lane for humans only?/
The roadblocks are for everyone's safety. I am sure the police are doing their best.
/Well their best is not enough./
Anyways, that is all the time we had for that call.
We will see you next time on Frank Conversations, broadcast live on PBA.
