Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is Crevus Radio Center 27 calling out to them from Adhomai’s shining pearl. 
Now as they all know, this is their wonderous Mister Crevus speaking to them and wishing them a wonderful day. 
Now don’t turn off that radio! We’ll begin the tunes soon, but first a word from our sponsors… The Rredouane’s Palace! Enjoy a party worthy of the gods!
And now here’s a rising star in the Crevan punk scene, it’s the Suns-Eaters!
[RANDOMNOTE]/A blaring punk dirge with a woman screeching over it begins/[RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to go![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to hide![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]She’s going to find him![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]And now it is his turn to be afraid![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]The streets are dark, she’ll find him![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]Raskara! RASKARA![RANDOMNOTE]

[RANDOMNOTE]Now he is afraid![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to go![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]He has nowhere to hide![RANDOMNOTE]
[RANDOMNOTE]She’s going to find him![RANDOMNOTE]

/The punk song trails off./
Wow, folks. What a voice on that dame, huh? Come and see the Sun-Eaters live in Crevus before they kick off their Das’nnra tour! 
Now before we begin our next segment, he’d like to ask his darling listeners if they’ve thought of doing the adventure of a lifetime. And no, he’s not trying to rope them into being on a smuggler crew! Come and see the frozen north of Adhomai through J’Shar Travels! Just remember to watch out for the plasmageists. No one wants frizzed out fur on their vacation.
Coming up next is the latest hit by Generr Morr’sori, and this one’s a real dozy folks.
