## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice
# SERVERNAME spacestation13

## Alert levels
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the station have passed. Security may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO The station has received reliable information about possible hostile activity on the station. Security staff may have weapons visible, random searches are permitted.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat has passed. Security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Random searches are still allowed.
ALERT_YELLOW_TO The station is now under an elevated alert status due to a confirmed biological hazard. All crew are to follow command instruction in order to ensure a safe return to standard operations.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO The self-destruct mechanism has been deactivated, there is still however an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times, random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_DELTA The station's self-destruct mechanism has been engaged. All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by heads of staff. Any violations of these orders can be punished by death. This is not a drill.

## Add a # in front of this to disable automatic admin rights for users connecting from the host the server is running on.

## Add a # infront of this if you want to use the SQL based admin system, the legacy system uses admins.txt. You need to set up your database to use the SQL based system.
ADMIN_LEGACY_SYSTEM

## Add a # infront of this if you want to use the SQL based banning system. The legacy systems use the files in the data folder. You need to set up your database to use the SQL based system.
BAN_LEGACY_SYSTEM

## Add a # here if you wish to use the setup where jobs have more access. This is intended for servers with low populations - where there are not enough players to fill all roles, so players need to do more than just one job. Also for servers where they don't want people to hide in their own departments.
JOBS_HAVE_MINIMAL_ACCESS

## Unhash this entry to have certain jobs require your account to be at least a certain number of days old to select. You can configure the exact age requirement for different jobs by editing
## the minimal_player_age variable in the files in folder /code/game/jobs/job/.. for the job you want to edit. Set minimal_player_age to 0 to disable age requirement for that job.
## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS

## Unhash this entry to have certain antag roles require your account to be at least a certain number of days old for round start and auto-spawn selection.
## Non-automatic antagonist recruitment, such as being converted to cultism is not affected. Has the same database requirements and notes as USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_ANTAGS

## Unhash to enable loading of age restrictions from age_restrictions.txt.
#LOAD_AGE_RESTRICTIONS_FROM_FILE

## Unhash this to use iterative explosions, keep it hashed to use circle explosions. Iterative explosions react to walls, airlocks and blast doors, making them look a lot cooler than the boring old circular explosions. They require more CPU, but are generally better to use.
