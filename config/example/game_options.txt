### HEALTH ###

## level of health at which a mob goes into continual shock (soft crit)
HEALTH_THRESHOLD_SOFTCRIT 0

## level of health at which a mob becomes unconscious (crit)
HEALTH_THRESHOLD_CRIT -50

## level of health at which a mob becomes dead
HEALTH_THRESHOLD_DEAD -100

## Determines whether bones can be broken through excessive damage to the organ
## 0 means bones can't break, 1 means they can
BONES_CAN_BREAK 1
## Determines whether limbs can be amputated through excessive damage to the organ
## 0 means limbs can't be amputated, 1 means they can
LIMBS_CAN_BREAK 1

## multiplier which enables organs to take more damage before bones breaking or limbs being destroyed
## 100 means normal, 50 means half
ORGAN_HEALTH_MULTIPLIER 100

## multiplier which influences how fast organs regenerate naturally
## 100 means normal, 50 means half
ORGAN_REGENERATION_MULTIPLIER 75

### REVIVAL ###

### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.


## This will globally modify the movement speed of all mobs.
## Note that it can do so unproportionally, meaning you'll lose the relationships between the different species. As such, modifying the delay multipliers below should be preferred.
WALK_SPEED 4

## The following two will globally affect all movement speed, while retaining the proportional relationships between the different mob's movement speeds.
## Ideally, you want to modify these. Any value between 0 and 1 will increase speed by decreasing the movement delay, anything above 1 will slow everyone down by increasing the delay.
WALK_DELAY_MULTIPLIER 1
RUN_DELAY_MULTIPLIER 1
VEHICLE_DELAY_MULTIPLIER 1

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 1
MONKEY_DELAY 1
ALIEN_DELAY 1
METROID_DELAY 1
ANIMAL_DELAY 1


### Miscellaneous ###

## Config options which, of course, don't fit into previous categories.

## Remove the # in front of this config option to have loyalty implants spawn by default on your server.
#USE_LOYALTY_IMPLANTS


## Sunlight Settings ##

# How many tiles should be between each light source. Higher is more accurate, but may take longer to process. Too low will freeze the server during updates.
# You probably should leave this unset.
#SUNLIGHT_ACCURACY 8

# The Z-level the sun is generated at. Keep in mind that light can only go downwards when setting this.
#SUNLIGHT_Z 7
