Wait, what was that? 
Something is crawling on you!
Is any of this real?
You can't catch your breath!
Something's watching you...   
You feel unsteady!
You're sure you've never been to this place before...
You can't feel your skin!
What just brushed your shoulder?
You hear someone whispering to you. It sounds so familiar.
When are you getting that drink you ordered?
Wait, where did your child go? What did they look like again..? You have one, right?
Crap, that assignment is due today!
When did you die, again? It's hard to remember... 
You'll die if it gets any warmer!
Weren't you getting married today?
Why is it so cold here?
You need to get away from here, it's not safe!
Who are all these people? 
You feel exhausted!
You're so thirsty!
Where did you put your jacket?
Finally, you can see again!
Your face feels soft.
When was your funeral supposed to be?
This place has changed...
Why is it so. Damn. Loud?!
Oh no...
You feel itchy all over!
Someone's behind you!
Where did your gun go?
You feel like you're getting sick.
Your blood feels weird.
Someone here was trying to kill you, you just know it!
Wait, this isn't your ID.
