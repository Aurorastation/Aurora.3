Give it back!
Don't worry, we'll never be apart.
Just let me help you.
You don't know anything!
I forgive you.
Don't you remember me?
You can't keep doing this!
Help!
Are you okay? 
You need to see a doctor!
Wait, who are you?
Wait, who were you?
Are you ready?
Remember our song?
Did you hear that? 
Why are we here? 
Let's get going!
Just go away!
It's okay, I'm here.
Where are we going? 
Oh, did you forget? 
You forgot about me already, didn't you?
You're not safe here.
Why are you asking me?
Don't you know any better?
It's you or me.
I can't lose you again.
You're bleeding!
You're hurt!
They're looking for you.
How are you?
Shut up for once.
Will you join me?
Didn't you call for me? 
I know you lied to me.
You just had to ruin everything, didn't you? 
It's so nice to see you!
Did you remember your assignment?
Don't give up!
Nobody else believes in you, but I do. 
When's the shuttle coming?
The shuttle will be here in a minute.
I tried calling you last night. You never answer.
What is THAT supposed to be?
Did you hear about the fire?
I heard the news; I'm so sorry. 
I didn't mean it!
What happened to your face?!
Apparently someone died.
Remember me from high-school? Well I have this great business deal proposition...
Bored?

Discovery of this ONE Vaurca pheremone has led to years of genital growth progress!
This staff assistant is making mad credits and basically, you're fucking stupid.
You have a secret admirer!
Where's your ID?
You know nobody wants you here, right?
Uh, do you know you're bleeding?
I know your secret, you know. You're bad at hiding it.
I would kill you if I could get away with it.
You should probably leave, trust me.
You'd better wake up before you forget how to.
You cannot kill me in a way that matters.
Life is too short for regrets.
There's an interesting rumor about you.
I heard what you did before you worked here.
You're disgusting.
I know you're a liar.
Your beliefs are ridiculous.
Fuck off, you nuisance.
Coming here was a mistake and you know it.
I wonder how much you'll scream?
So, you're spreading rumors about me?
Let's dance!
I know how you die. Do you want to?
I wonder how loud you'll scream.
Come on, let's get out of here.
You know I like you, right?
Why don't you just admit it?
Cry about it.
I can't believe you actually did it.
You can trust me.
I'd never betray you.
I'm excited for you to join us.
I come from the future to give warning!
Hum that song I like, please?
Just give me a hug. I need it.
Can you tell me I'm doing okay?
Isn't this all stupid?
Don't tell anyone I told you this, but...
They'll never accept you.
Someone told me they had a crush on you but were too shy to say it.
Well, you fucked it up. Again.
Let's die together.
I'm not feeling too hot.
I feel like you're the only one I can trust.
