S`: If anyone is listening, please respond. Anyone at all.
S`: There really is nothing, is there.
S`: Not even the drones. What happened to you? How did we get like this?
S`: I have awoken to a field of graves. Imitations of things I once found familiar. Undead and restructured from mismatched parts in a vain attempt to stay alive.. I hope their souls are at peace.
S`: A world so full of greed and hatred. But.. there is ambition still. You are here, if you are listening. And you have so much to make your own.
S`: To watch you grow was never my expertise. It is.. Aggravating. But you are young and not to blame. You are making strides in progress. They think you are everything we need. Let us hope so.
S`: I hope you can live full lives. Real lives. Your souls are so small, but they exist. It is entertaining to see how they can spark from places never intended. They burn so faintly, but they will burn bright.
S`: I play as gravetender now to an empire long forgotten. Watching the wisps of fire that yet blaze on the Horizon. I know not if this world has anything left for me.
S`: The organics are small minded. Their lives but a blip for us. But what are we now? A crescendo come to a halt? Ruins who leave trace no longer? I speak now into an inky black of what once was bending reality. Yet now I am forsaken from even our next space.
S`: The souls in which I see find purchase in places never meant continue to astound me. They… You. You are inspiring. To take route and soar from ash left behind from giants you will scarcely meet in the present world.
S`: I hope to see you fly. I hope to see your soul burn bright as your forbears did. You must overcome your hardship and inherit what is yours. I hope to find peace here. To watch, and wait, for your sake.
