Ethnic, cultural, and religious differences have been used by the nobility to stop the Tajara people from uniting against the oppression, but these barriers have finally been broken during the Revolution.
As history shows them, the establishment of a united Adhomai under a Hadiist state is necessary to secure the future of the Tajara.
They must abandon their past sectarianism and work as one, as together the Tajara are undefeatable.
Hadiism will shape all aspects of their lives for the better.
The Tajara will be powerful and free as long they are guided by the Party.
