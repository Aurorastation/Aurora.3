Ethnic, cultural, and religious differences have been used by the nobility to stop the Tajara people from uniting against the oppression, but these barriers have finally been broken during the Revolution.
As history shows them, the establishment of a united Adhomai under a Hadiist state is necessary to secure the future of the Tajara.
They must abandon their past sectarianism and work as one, as together the Tajara are undefeatable.
Hadiism will shape all aspects of their lives for the better.
The Tajara will be powerful and free as long they are guided by the Party.
"Comrades, in this struggle we fight to protect the progress we have fought so hard to make in the preceding decades. Our march forever onwards for a Hadiist society must not be stopped by the usurpers who would see us become a brutish military dictatorship, nor those fetid imperialists who would restore the atrocities of the old ways." - President Njadrasanukii Hadii
