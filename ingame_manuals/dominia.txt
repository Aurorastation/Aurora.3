The Tribunal's edicts are absolute. The breaking of an edict is to be punished.
Praise the Goddess in all that you do, and bless those who assist you in your workings.
Spread the good news of the Goddess in all that you do, that all may receive her blessings.
Respect the laws of other Empires but worry not as they shall soon be brought into the Tribunal's benevolent reach. 
All synthetic life forms within Dominia space shall be sought out and destroyed where found.
Lies are abhorrent before Her, especially those told for personal gain.
Those who escape the divine court's judgment must be destroyed where found.
Those who escape the divine courts judgment and flee outside Dominian space should be encouraged to return and confess so they might face divine judgment. In death they shall be absolved. 
It is the duty of all the holy to encourage those that flee to return to us, so that they might be forgiven.
Augmentation for the sake of augmentation is a corruption of the temple that is one's body, and can risk the very soul should one proceed too far with it.
Goddess through the Tribunal, the Tribunal through me, Goddess protects, the Tribunal protects, thus I am immortal.
My mind is water, guide my thoughts.
Goddess gives, the Tribunal sees, thus I keep faith, thus I have no fear, thus I have no mercy, thus I have no regrets.
One Empire, under the Goddess, whom through the Tribunal, reigns.
We serve the Goddess without reserve, without question, without hesitation.
Goddess bless the Immortal Empire. Goddess bless us all.
My hands are yours with which to craft, my eyes your mirror.
The Tribunal sees all, knows all, is all.
Three in One; Three in I. Soldier for the Goddess; Scholar for myself; Artisan for our Empire.
To see and listen is divine, for all that may be seen or heard is done through the Tribunal as it is by the faithful.
