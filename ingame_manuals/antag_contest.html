<h1>2nd Antagonist Contest Help</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
The conflict between the synthetic's rights activitists and their opposition has reached a boiling point in Tau Ceti. With actual legislation now on the line, the major powers in the system have started to use their influence in an attempt to be on the winning side. The NSS Exodus is sure to be caught in the approaching maelstrom of trouble.

<h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
Any player can <b>Opt in</b> to the competition. If you wish your character to be able to fight for one side or another, you can use the <b>My Character Status</b> verb in the <b>Contest</b> tab to set them up.<br>

<h3>Antagonist Gameplay</h3>
When you are a traitor, mercenary, raider, or a ninja, you can use the <b>Request Objective</b> button from the <b>Contest</b> tab, in order to select yourself an objective for the round. The completion and failure of these objectives will be tracked, and this will decide the winner. <b>Note</b> that objective assignment can fail! This will happen whenever an objective's goal is unattainable. You can try to request another objective, or simply conduct freeform action with your antagonist status that you think would further your side's goal!<br>
The <b>contracts database</b>, accessible through the Web Interface, will also be used! You can access this through your traitor uplink, or via the <b>WebInt</b> button up top right! If you cannot get a mechanical objective, look around there!

<h3>General Gameplay</h3>
Note that you do not have to be an antagonist to participate in the contest. As a non-antagonist, you are still free to recruit people to your side, spread propaganda, have gatherings, etcetera. The rules only require that you <b>not</b> initiate clearly violent and antagonistic action. If you have any concerns as to whether or not what you're planning to do is permitted, you can always adminhelp!
