Within each Soul burns four Flames, those of Self, Community, Faith, and Light. A flame that burns too dim condemns the Soul to a dark demise; a flame that burns too bright will consume the Soul in wicked sin.
A Soul must truly understand themselves if they are to prosper. If a Flame does not master its own dance, it will burn out in the wind, and be gone forever.
In the hearth of the Community, a Flame that seeks only its own warmth will soon find itself alone in the cold. It is in the shared warmth of charity that all Flames find their enduring glow.
To have Faith is to trust the Truth; to be paranoid and mistrustful is to be lost in one's own mind. A flame that bends too readily to the winds of surrender will find itself extinguished forever. It is the steadfast light of Truth that endures, unwavering, even in the storm.
Light and shadow, in their eternal dance, must not consume one another. For a flame that blinds itself to either, risks losing the very essence of its being, fading into the void.
Death only awaits the evil and those with dark hearts; to die is to be cast into darkness, never to see again. For the Faithful, reincarnation and enlightenment await.
The Stars of the sky are eternal beacons, forever burning, and we look to them for guidance, both in body and in spirit. The Stars guide everyone in this universe, to life, and to death.
O Ennoia, source of light, Guide us in the eternal night. Keeper of balance, pure and bright, Illuminate our path with your sight. In moments of darkness, in times of plight, Lead us with your wisdom, O radiant light. O Ennoia, beacon in our flight, Grant us sunrise from this endless night.
The Guardian of Assunzione lays in wait in its Prison, at the heart of Assunzione's Star. We live with the promise that one day it will emerge from its prison, and bring day to Assunzione's eternal night.
Light is sacred, for in the vastness of space it is so scarce. Light gives sight, wisdom; and it also gives life, and warmth. Prosperity without light takes nothing short of a miracle.
Assunzione was once a beautiful place, bathed in beautiful aurorae, and blessed with gold and lush, vibrant life by Ennoia's grace.
Perhaps the blessings were too much; in addition to verdant life, Assunzione was also victim to many solar flares and storms, damaging electronics and sometimes sickening citizens with radiation.
To the progenitors of the world spoke Ennoia, not of words but of dreams: Dreams of a world that would end, if preparations were not made. After much debate, great Domes were built around the cities of Assunzione to shield them from what might become.
When the Star went out, the people were caught by surprise. Preprations were made, but they were not done fast enough. Every crop withered, every livestock animal perished, and every solar farm fell dark.
What hope could there have been of a dying world? There was no sun, no power, no food. Hundreds died by the day; the streets gave rise to rot and stench. When light did come, it came in the form of great fires that ravaged the cities, killing thousands more.
Without the great and often fatal sacrifices of our ancestors, who braved starvation and hypothermia to bring power to Assunzione, shrouded in darkness, the world would have surely ended, and its people perished. We must honor them, by following their way of selfless duty.
To the first Foresayers spoke Ennoia, not of words but of pictures: pictures of a prospering world, bathed in day, cities as bright as noon even though beyond the glass there was nothing but darkness. So, Ennoia showed, that there was hope for us yet.\
Luceism is named for the plant of miracles, the luce vine: a curious specimen that thrives in both light and dark, its fruit giving a soft, blue glow.
