// Synthetic internals represent things that are not physically modelled as an organ, but are rather part of the organ.
// That means wiring, plating, and electronics. Damaging organs has adverse effects on these components.
// The goal is to emulate damaging effects similar to arterial bleeding, infections, etc. on organics.

// The specific effects of each synthetic internal can vary organ by organ. They all have different health measurements as well.
// These measurements can change depending on the organ they are attached to.
