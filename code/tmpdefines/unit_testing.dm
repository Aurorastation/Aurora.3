 *   This file is used by Travis to indicate that Unit Tests are to be ran.
 *   Do not add anything but the UNIT_TEST definition here as it will be overwritten by Travis when running tests.
 *
 *   This is expected to not be included by default, if you need to set this manually, use the code\__DEFINES\manual_unit_testing.dm file instead.
 *
 *
 *   Should you wish to edit set UNIT_TEST to 1 like so:
 *   #define UNIT_TEST 1
