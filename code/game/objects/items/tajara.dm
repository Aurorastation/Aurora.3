			the Republican Guard was formed by absorbing all of these units as a hard-hitting highly mobile airborne special forces unit in 2435. They primarily draw recruits from \
			promising and outstanding members of the Ha'narr Corps, as well as shock infantry divisions, not at all unlike their original founding members. Their iconic light blue \
			berets inspire awe and admiration on the battlefield among their teammates, and fear among their enemies. The Republican Guard primarily deploys by airdropping from high \

			proved to be a vital weakness which these units corrected for. The training regime for Ha'narrii is typically anywhere in between one to three months, with recruits trained \
			in basic survival and reconnaissance skills emphasizing on self dependence within the frozen wilderness of Adhomai.  As a scouting unit, Ha'narri travel lightly on equipment, \
			carrying primarily the essentials for survival and only a token amount of ammunition. Many detachments also make use of snow skiis in order to travel quickly in mountainous regions. \
