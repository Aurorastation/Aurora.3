				<h1>Raising Bees</h1>

				Bees require their hive to be built near plants in order to feed on them, so construct it somewhere in a garden. Insert the honey frames so they can start preparing honey.<br>
				The lid needs to be closed to give them a safe environment to breed in, but you'll need to open it to perform maintenance and extract honey, open and close with a crowbar.<br>
				Use a smoker to calm them down before extracting honey, and if the bees get free, smoke them until they calm down, scoop them up with the net and return them to the hive. <br>
				The smoker runs on welding fuel, be sure to keep it topped up <br>
				Use a plant analyser to check on the hive, it'll let you know the population and their progress on making honey <br>
				Once you've extracted some honey frames, run them through the provided extractor machine to retrieve the products, and return the empty frames to the hive.<br>
				Don't forget to wear a thick suit, a biosuit is included for your safety. Bee stings can hurt <br>

				And last but not least, prepare for future expansion. Your bees will grow fast, and at some point you'll find the hive full. You can construct a second one and frames for it with enough wood.
