 * Default behaviour is to call `get_examine_text()` and send the result to the mob

 * - distance - The distance in tiles from `user` to `src`
 * - is_adjacent - Whether `user` is adjacent to `src`
 * - infix String - String that is appended immediately after the atom's name
 * - suffix String - Additional string appended after the atom's name and infix
 * - show_extended Boolean - Whether to show extended examination text or not. Only passed to get_examine_text()
 *
 * Returns boolean - The caller always expects TRUE
