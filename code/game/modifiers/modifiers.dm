//Temporary modifiers system, by Nanako

//This system is designed to allow making non-permanant, reversible changes to variables of any atom,
//Though the system will be primarily used for altering properties of mobs, it can work on anything.

This system works through a few main procs which should be overridden:
All overridden procs should contain a call to parent at the start, before any other code


Activate: This applies the effects. its here that you change any variables.
	The author is also responsible here for storing any information necessary to later revert these changes

Deactivate: This proc removes the effects. The author is responsible for writing it to reverse the changes cleanly
	If using a strength var or any other kind of dynamic determinor of effects
	It is very important NOT to factor that in when deactivating, because it may be changed while active
	Instead, factor it in while activating and save the delta of the changed values.
	that is, how much you added/subtracted
	Apply that saved value in reverse when deactivating.

Both activate and deactivate are stateful. Activate will not run if active is true.
Deactivate will not run if active is false

Process: Called once every second while the effect is active. Usually this will only see if its time
	to recheck validity, but it can be overridden to add extra per-tick functionality.

When created, a status effect will take the following parameters in new
	Mandatory:
		1. Affected atom
		2. Modifier type
		3. Source atom (not mandatory if type is custom)

	Optional:
		4. Source data
		5. Strength
		6. Duration
		7. Check interval



//The affected atom is mandatory, without something to affect the modifier cannot exist

//Modifier type is one of a selection of constants which determines the automated validity checking.
	It does not enforce anything about the changes or other functionality. A valid option is mandatory

//Source object is the thing that this modifier is based on, or anchored to.
	//It is used as a point of reference in validity checks. Usually mandatory but some types do not require it

//Source data provides additional information for validity, such as a maximum range from the source.
	//Only required for certain types

//Strength can be passed in by the caller and used insetting or removing the variable changes.
	//It is never required for anything and not incorporated in base behaviour

//Duration can be used for any type except custom. The modifier will cease to be valid
	//this long after it is created
	//Duration is decremented every proc until it falls below zero.
	//This is used so that duration can be refreshed or increased before the modifier expires to prolong it

//Check interval is a time, in deciseconds, between validity checks. a >0 value is required here,
	//the default is 300 (every 30 seconds),
	//Check interval is used to generate a world time at which the next check will run


Please note that automated validity checking is primarily as a safety, to ensure things aren't left
when they shouldn't be. If you desire something removed in a timely manner, it's recommended to manually
call the effect's end proc from your code when you're done with it. For example, if a piece of equipment
applying a modifier is taken off.

Setting the check interval very low just to cause the effect to be removed quickly is bad practise
it should be avoided in favour of manual removal where possible

//Modifier types
//These are needed globally and cannot be undefined

#define MODIFIER_EQUIPMENT	1
//The status effect remains valid as long as it is worn upon the affected mob.
//Worn here means it must be held in a valid equip slot, which does not include pockets, storage, or held in hands.
//The affected atom must be a mob

#define MODIFIER_ITEM	2
//The modifier remains valid as long as the item is in the target's contents,
//no matter how many layers deep, if it can be found by recursing up, it is valid
//This is essentially a more permissable version of equipment, and works when held, in backpacks, pockets, etc
//It can also be used on non-mob targets

#define MODIFIER_AURA	3
//The modifier remains valid as long as the target's turf is within a range of the source's turf
//The range is defined in source data
//A range of zero is still valid if source and target are on the same turf. Sub-zero range is invalid
//Works on any affected atom

#define MODIFIER_TIMED	4
//The modifier remains valid as long as the duration has not expired.
//Note that a duration can be used on any time, this type is just one that does not
//check anything else but duration.
//Does not require or use a source atom
//Duration is mandatory for this type.
//Works on any atom


#define MODIFIER_CUSTOM	5
//The validity check will always return 1. The author is expected to override
//it with custom validity checking behaviour.
//Does not require or use a source atom
//Does not support duration



//Override Modes:
//An override parameter is passed in with New, which determines what to do if a modifier of
//the same type already exists on the target

#define MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_DENY	0
//The default. If a modifier of our type already exists, the new one is discarded. It will Qdel itself
//Without adding itself to any lists

#define MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_NEIGHBOR	1
//The new modifier ignores the existing one, and adds itself to the list alongside it
//This is not recommended but you may have a specific application
//Using the strength var and updating the effects is preferred if you want to stack multiples
//of the same type of modifier on one mob

#define MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_REPLACE 	2
//Probably the most common nondefault and most useful. If an old modifier of the same type exists,
//Then the old one is first stopped without suspending, and deleted.
//Then the new one will add itself as normal

#define MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_REFRESH 	3
//This mode will overwrite the variables of the old one with our new values
//It will also force it to remove and reapply its effects
//This is useful for applying a lingering modifier, by refreshing its duration

#define MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_STRENGTHEN	4
//Almost identical to refresh, but it will only apply if the new modifer has a higher strength value
//If the existing modifier's strength is higher than the new one, the new is discarded

#define MODIFIER_OVERRIDE_CUSTOM	5
//Calls a custom override function to be overwritten
