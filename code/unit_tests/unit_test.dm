/*   Unit Tests originally designed by Ccomp5950
 *
 *   Tests are created to prevent changes that would create bugs or change expected behaviour.
 *   For the most part I think any test can be created that doesn't require a client in a mob or require a game mode other then extended
 *
 *   The easiest way to make effective tests is to create a "template" if you intend to run the same test over and over and make your actual
 *   tests be a "child object" of those templates.  Be sure and name your templates with the word "template" somewhere in var/name.
 *
 *   The goal is to have all sorts of tests that run and to run them as quickly as possible.
 *
 *   Tests that require time to run we instead just check back on their results later instead of waiting around in a sleep(1) for each test.
 *   This allows us to finish unit testing quicker since we can start other tests while we're waiting on that one to finish.
 *
 *   An example of that is listed in mob_tests.dm with the human_breath test.  We spawn the mob in space and set the async flag to 1 so that we run the check later.
 *   After 10 life ticks for that mob we check it's oxyloss but while that is going on we've already ran other tests.
 *
 *   If your test requires a significant amount of time...cheat on the timers.  Either speed up the process/life runs or do as we did in the timers for the shuttle
 *   transfers in zas_tests.dm   we move a shuttle but instead of waiting 3 minutes we set the travel time to a very low number.
 *
 *   At the same time, Unit tests are intended to reflect standard usage so avoid changing to much about how stuff is processed.
 *
 *
 *   WRITE UNIT TEST TEMPLATES AS GENERIC AS POSSIBLE (makes for easy reusability)
 *
