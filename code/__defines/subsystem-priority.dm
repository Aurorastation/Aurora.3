// Something to remember when setting priorities: SS_TICKER runs before Normal, which runs before SS_BACKGROUND.

// Priorities are a weight that controls how much of the BYOND tick the subsystem will be allowed to use. 50 is the default, so a subsystem with a priority of 100 would
//  be allocated twice the amount of runtime as normal, and 25 would get half the amount.
