Produced in cooperation with Zavodskoi Interstellar, the ZA-98/5 features and updates reloading mechanism and further improvements to the ballistic profile of its shots. This naval gun is commonly seen on Imperial Fleet corvettes and frigates as their main armament, and is often seen on larger Fleet vessels as a secondary armament to support larger weaponry. It is easily capable of destroying a smaller vessel if the Goddess ensures its shot flies true."
