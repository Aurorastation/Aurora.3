Its fame among post-War Admirals was such that its name and purpose has largely remained the same, with a new 'Type' iteration commissioned every decade or so. With the expulsion of Zavodskoi and its subsidiary from Solarian space, this aging giant and symbol of military might is under threat of being consumed by the resulting arms manufacturing vacuum."
