// This mob is a lie. Similar to /mob/abstract it's not really supposed to do much.
// It is used as a fake announcer so that we have a lightweight mob to pass to radio broadcasts.
// To use it simply instantiate it, store a reference to it - it can be reused, so no reason
// to delete it immediately. Just before a broadcast call PrepareBroadcast with desired arguments,
// then right after the broadcast call ResetAfterBroadcast so you can re-use the mob without issues next time.
