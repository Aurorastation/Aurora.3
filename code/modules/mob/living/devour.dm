//This file contains variables and helper functions for mobs that can eat other mobs

//There are two ways to eat a mob:
	//Swallowing whole can only be done if the mob is sufficiently small
		//It will place the mob inside you, and slowly digest it,
			//Digesting deals brute+fire damage to the victim and adds protein to your stomach based on the damage dealt.
			//Mob will be deleted from your contents when fully digested.
				//Mob is fully digested when it has taken fire+brute damage equal to its max health plus 50% (calculated after death)

	//Devouring eats the mob piece by piece. Taking a bite periodically
		//Each bite deals genetic damage, and drains blood.
			//Adds protein to your stomach based on quantities.
		//Mob is fully digested when it has taken genetic damage equal to its max health.  This continues past death if necessary
		//Devouring is interrupted if you or the mob move away from each other, or if the eater gets disabled.
