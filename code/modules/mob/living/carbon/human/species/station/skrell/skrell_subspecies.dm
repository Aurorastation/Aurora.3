	adapted to survive within the depths of the Homeworld's seas. Typically sporting much more pronounced webbings \
	for faster swimming, as well as larger and more monocular eyes to better perceive their environment. They also \
	possess a small tail that acts as a rudder; making them capable of changing direction at high speeds when underwater. \
	The high-pressure environments in which they thrived and evolved have also resulted in a lower metabolic rate for \
	the ethnicity, resulting in easier fat accrual."
