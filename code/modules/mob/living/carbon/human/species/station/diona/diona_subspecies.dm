	Orion Spur. They have various forms comprised of cat-sized caterpillar-like creatures with a curious, childlike disposition - called Dionae Nymphs. \
	Almost every aspect of the species is a mystery; their origins, their behaviour, and functions. What is known is that they are capable of great intellectual and biological \
	feats that are studied across the Spur. Biologically, Dionae are a form of gestalt consciousness, however, it is only evident in forms that amount to two or more Nymphs.\
	Dionae survive primarily on off of the electromagnetic spectrum and biological matter."
