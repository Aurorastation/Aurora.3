	raised in, although bark-reduction treatments exist. Generally a gestalt remains a Coeus until they are about 80 years old, although some can be as old as 180. Due to having less bark than \
	their older counterparts, Coeus are faster but less resistant to damage. Due to their younger age, Coeus are also generally less experienced than older gestalts, as such they tend to look up \
	towards more experienced gestalts as a hand to help guide them. As a result of being more formative and idealistic, Coeus tend to be more pacifistic and less prone towards any kind of \
	violence, including against more simple-minded creatures such as monkeys."
