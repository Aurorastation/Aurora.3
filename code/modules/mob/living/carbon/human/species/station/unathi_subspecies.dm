	the body is just a shell; they believe that meat is animated by soul, while metal is powered by electricity, and thus replacing one's body with metal empowers the soul.<br><br> \
	They are managed, but not ruled, by their god Oss, a silent deity who quietly facilitates the Aut'akh's prosperity behind the scenes. They are almost excessively friendly, \
	seeing all the beings of the galaxy as potential Aut'akh or allies for the Aut'akh. They also hold a strong spiritual tradition, believing that highly charismatic or intelligent \
	people or strong fighters are blessed with magic"
