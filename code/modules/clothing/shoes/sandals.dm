	Typically, Zazehal Festivals are thrown every month of the warm season in which Unathi strew freshly killed birds across the shoreline and collect these creatures with baskets.\
	The fungi that grow on their skin is harvested and used as an exotic seasoning,\

	Originally used for warriors, they became widespread for their comfort and durability.\
	Although made for the Unathi anatomy, they have picked up popularity among other species."
