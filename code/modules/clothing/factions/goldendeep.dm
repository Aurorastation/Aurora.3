	due to the appeal among other civilisations of the Orion Spur. Lux-Igmatic made a considerable fortune before the methods to create the gold-laced fabric design were leaked to competitors. Gold-lace and \
	gold-appearance clothing is now popular within many Golden Deep brands, but this was the first, and still carries considerable prestige (and a price tag to match)."

	choice due to their low surface area - thereby not blocking airflow to keep the chassis cool. Nowadays, of course, cooling through clothes is hardly a problem at all, but there remains some fondness for the garments once worn by their poorer \
	(and more poorly-designed) predecessors."

	opportunity, and soon enough it was impossible to pass a clothing store without seeing these vests on display. Using an innovative process to reduce the amount of metal being woven into these garments, the cost has been kept relatively low. The pricetag \
	may still be far out of the reach of the masses, but it barely approaches a fraction of the cost of a golden two piece, and is certainly far, far cheaper than the dresses made by Lux-Igmatic themself."
