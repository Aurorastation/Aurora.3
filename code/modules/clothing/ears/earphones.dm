/*
	Earphones that use our sound_player system to play sounds from a music cartridge to their wearer.

	Current Features:
	- All earphones have a cartridge slot. Cartridges can be inserted by clicking an earphone, and removed via an eject_music_cartridge() verb.
	- Inserting a cartridge will load a playlist containing /datum/tracks, where track names and sound files are loaded.
	- Shift+Clicking will Start/Stop a playlist, creating or deleting an active sound_player token.
	- Alt+Clicking with Pause/Unpause the current track, preserving an active sound_player token.
	- attack_self will eject the music cartridge. Ejecting a music cartridge also terminates the sound_player token.
	- Volume controllable via verb.

	Missing features i am too weak to figure out:
	- There is no autoâ€”next song, and a user must manually use next_song() or previous_song() verbs to iterate through a playlist.
	- Part and parcel with no auto-next: Tracks automatically loop due to using the PlayLoopingSound() proc. Ideally, tracks should not loop.
	- There is no accomodation for user-uploaded sound files.
	- There are no UI implementations of earphone controls, which could be more user friendly.
