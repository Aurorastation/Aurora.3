///////////////////////////////////////////////Condiments
//Notes by Darem: The condiments food-subtype is for stuff you don't actually eat but you use to modify existing food. They all
//	leave empty containers when used up and can be filled/re-filled with other items. Formatting for first section is identical
//	to mixed-drinks code. If you want an object that starts pre-loaded, you need to make it in addition to the other code.

//Food items that aren't eaten normally and leave an empty container behind.
