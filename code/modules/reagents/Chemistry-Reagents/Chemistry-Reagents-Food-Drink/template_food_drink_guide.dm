// As apart of an effort to make food and drinks singletons easier to maintain, consider this the reference guide for how to implement new food and drink singletons


// File level division:
// Food and drink will now be stored in broad "cultural" groupings. Tajaran food goes in the Tajara section, Skrell in the Skrell section, etc.
// A list of "generic" human food/drinks will be compiled as well. These are food items that aren't attached to one human faction. Burgers, steaks, sushi, etc.
// The division between generic and cultural food will be if its mentioned that it belongs to that place, not where in our real world its inspiration comes from.


// In file division:
// In each file, the different types of food and drink should be broken up into different sections. Only these 9 should be considered "mandatory", however,
// further divisions can be made that deviate from this list. If a culture has say, a lot of a particular kind of dish, that can be made into its own section.
// The main 9 is as follows:
//
// Food (Anything you can cook)
// Junk Food (anything bought in a vending machine or otherwise packaged and not made)
// Meat
//
// Ingredients (spices, syrups, etc)
//
// Alcoholic Drinks
// Non Alcoholic
// Soda
// Tea
// Coffee
//
//
// This is just to establish something familiar to players via the Food and Drinks wiki pages (at time of writing, Feb 2025.).
