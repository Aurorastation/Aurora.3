//---- Descriptions of destination types
//Space stations can be purpose built for a number of different things, but generally require regular shipments of essential supplies.
//Corvettes are small, fast warships generally assigned to border patrol or chasing down smugglers.
//Battleships are large, heavy cruisers designed for slugging it out with other heavies or razing planets.
//Yachts are fast civilian craft, often used for pleasure or smuggling.
//Destroyers are medium sized vessels, often used for escorting larger ships but able to go toe-to-toe with them if need be.
//Frigates are medium sized vessels, often used for escorting larger ships. They will rapidly find themselves outclassed if forced to face heavy warships head on.
