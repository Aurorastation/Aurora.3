	in critical condition by placing them in stasis, so they can be treated at a later time.<br>\
	<br>\
	In order for it to work, it must be loaded with chemicals, and the temperature of the solution must reach a certain point. Additionally, it \
	requires a supply of pure oxygen, provided by canisters that are attached. The most commonly used chemicals in the chambers are Cryoxadone and \
	Clonexadone. Clonexadone is more effective in treating all damage, including Genetic damage, but is otherwise functionally identical.<br>\
	<br>\
	Activating the freezer nearby, and setting it to a temperature setting below 150, is recommended before operation! Further, any clothing the patient \
	is wearing that act as an insulator will reduce its effectiveness, and should be removed.<br>\
