	description_fluff = "Door jacks have become the new form of lockpicks in order to address the innovations of postmodern societies.<br>\
	Like lockpicks and lockpicking, door jacks and door jacking aren't particularly illegal per se, but can and have been used with criminal intent. \
	The designs of these door jacks vary greatly according to the kind of lock you're dealing with, though most of the time they make use of the Renton-7 model which \
	is designed with universability in mind.<br>\
	Most jacks on the civilian market are somewhat crude and simple, and don't actually provide much access beyond the standard \
	locks. With that, most of the time these are found attached to a pAI card to facilitate ease of use by having most of its operation handled by the AI.<br>\
	What kind of technology it uses depends on the manufacturer, but they often need to either be produced with the appropriate electrical medium, or have \
	an adapter installed."
