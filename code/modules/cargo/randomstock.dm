At roundstart, some items will spawn in the cargo warehouse. MANY items in fact.

Generally, 20-40 items of various sorts will spawn.

Most of them (70-90%) will be chosen from the common items list. These items are designed to be fairly
useful and likely to be helpful to the station. They will help cement cargo's supply role - as the
place to go when you want to find things you lack.

A smaller amount will be from the uncommon items. This is a combination of more powerful items, and
useless but interesting curios. The uncommon category tends towards interestingness and niche use

Rare items will spawn fairly infrequently, These are things that can have a significant
effect on the round, and most of the spawnable weapons are in these categories. Many of the rare
items are prime targets for an antag raiding cargo, or a desperate crew looking for things to fight with

Large items are a more broadly weighted category with a variety of rare and common items. The main
defining criteria of this category is that they are dense, and usually structures or machinery, and
thus require a dedicated tile for themselves to spawn in.

Many items which draw from random pools, like meds/aid/signs/figures/plushies/booze/etc,
have been given higher probabilitiesthan those which simply spawn preset items. This encourages
more variety, and keeps the odds of any one specific item to be about the same

Actual definitions for possible items go in the files in `./random_stock`. Use the macros `STOCK_ITEM_COMMON(id,prob)`, `STOCK_ITEM_UNCOMMON(id,prob)`, `STOCK_ITEM_RARE(id,prob)`,
	and `STOCK_ITEM_LARGE(id,prob)` to declare your spawn, and put your spawn code under the define like you're defining a proc. IDs must be unique within a category (common, large, etc),
	but can be duplicated across categories. Available parameters are `atom/L` (loc the object should be spawned at), and for large objects, `datum/cargospawner/CS` (a ref to the parent cargospawner)

Example:

STOCK_ITEM_COMMON(bees, 2)
	if (prob(95))
		new /mob/living/bees(L)
	else
		new /mob/living/bees/evil(L)

// The cargo_master datum is used to hold metadata about the cargo spawners. All subtypes are instantiated in misc_early to generate the cargo lists (as Atoms runs before Cargo).
// This also means that if you want to do something fancy with the spawning probability you can directly create a custom sub-datum of this
// instead of using the macros and override the get_probability proc or even the register_spawner proc.
