	lore_text = "Psionics are an older phenomenon, found in varying levels in all Orion Spur fauna, \
	but particularly actively in creatures around Jargon space. It is unknown in the universe for most sapients to be capable of active psionics, \
	but the Skrell are an extremely notable exception. Capable of pushing and pulling thoughts into and out of peoplesâ€™ minds, and constantly linked together by psionic fields and a shared dreamspace when they sleep. \
	Few legitimate studies have been done in the field of human psionics, and results have not been promising."
	mechanics_text = "Psionic operants have a brain icon on the bottom right of the HUD. They can click it to toggle \
	their powers, or examine it to see the details of how to invoke each power, as well as their mental state. Items \
	made of nullglass will stop the use of powers, and overuse of powers can cause lethal brain damage."
