	lore_text = "Psionics are a relatively new phenomenon theorized to be linked to long-term exposure \
	to deep, uninhabited space. A tiny, tiny subset of people exposed to such conditions can develop the \
	ability to perform small feats like levitating coins or removing a headache with nothing but their mind. \
	A decade of study has resulted in the SCG determining that these psionics, mild as they are, don't pose \
	an operational or health risk, but they do encourage operants to register with a psionic regulation body \
	like the Cuchulain Foundation. \
	<br><br> \
	However, psionics-enhancing implants, drugs and procedures are illegal in most human space, and \
	statistically seem to end in death for those foolish enough to make use of them. Being caught with a \
	cerebroenergetic enhancer, or the drug Three Eye, will net you a hefty prison sentence."
	mechanics_text = "Psionic operants have a brain icon on the bottom right of the HUD. They can click it to toggle \
	their powers, or examine it to see the details of how to invoke each power, as well as their mental state. Items \
	made of nullglass will stop the use of powers, and overuse of powers can cause lethal brain damage."
