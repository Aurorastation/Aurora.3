	name = RELIGION_QEBLAK
	description = "The most ancient of these religions and one with the largest following has a decentralized and less stringent system, although a deist one at its core, it lacks \
	strict practices that other galactic religions have, instead it instills the sense of exploring the world as we know it, starting with their home planet and then beyond, and \
	promoting the need to understand it all. From the most minute of particles to the largest galactic entities. This belief maintains that the existence of the universe was brought \
	upon something, that while the process of how it came to be understood, the catalyst of it all is sought, as all things require some measure of action, so in order to do that, \
	the collective races needs to uncover every mystery in the galaxy in order to fully understand everything within it, and possibly beyond. This makes Qeblak a religion that highly \
	celebrates the pursuit of knowledge, exploration, science and innovation, to them, science is part of culture."

/datum/religion/skrell/weishii
	name = RELIGION_WEISHII
	description = "A new belief within the Federation following the liberation from Glorsh. Following the collapse of the Federation under Glorsh totallarian, the Skrell as a species \
	had endured extreme tragedy, atrocities and wholesale genocide. This has spawned this new belief, one that favored a more spiritual attempt at gaining insight with the galaxy, in \
	the belief that the constellations all around us hold the key to understanding their fate and place in the galaxy. Whereas a member of the Qeblak faith would learn and study, a \
	member of the Weishii faith would meditate, attempt to get a deeper inner understanding. This is generally attempted through the usage of Wulumunusha, a flowering vine that has \
	came into existence following the meddling of the biosphere of Xrim by Glorsh."

/datum/religion/skrell/suurka
	name = RELIGION_SUURKA
	description = "While it is true that the Skrell society does not resort to violence unless necessary, there have been exceptions to this in various circumstances. This belief abhors \
	what it views as the present complacency and docility of the Skrell, instead pushing for a more aggressive and brutal way of conflict. It values strength and force as guiding principles \
	for society. This belief has gained traction in the Traverse following the fall of Glorsh and by some Skrell living beyond the Federation. These followers within the Federation tend to be shunned, \
	with authorities claiming their brutal and 'uncivilized' ways set a bad precedent for Skrell throughout the galaxy. Moreover, most Skrell are not physically gifted, and are often outclassed by most \
	other species. Still, followers of the Suur'ka beliefs train their body and mind to handle a variety of different circumstances. Training centers exist but are usually privately \
	funded and require membership access. Mental dojos are often tranquil, recluse places where Skrell learn and adopt the tenants of self-preservation and weapon-use."

/datum/religion/skrell/kirgul
	name = RELIGION_KIRGUL
	description = "Kir'gul is the belief that emphasises the focus on the full individuality of a Skrell, suppressing the Wake as to not push people into thoughts that were not truly \
	their own. This belief has mainly gained traction among the Skrell that live amongst alien dominant species, where the Federation fueled collective emphasis is not as prevalent. \
	After the fall of Glorsh-Omega, this belief has seen significant traction amongst both foreign Skrell and domestic, as many Skrell are now wary about the threat of a collective \
	entity, whether that be artificial or biological. This belief system enforces the Ya'Qu, or 'the right to live', a saying that is similar to the human 'live in the moment'. As \
	such, the Skrell following the Kir'gul belief system often are explorers, artists, or other such creators, and reject authority in favor of individuality."
