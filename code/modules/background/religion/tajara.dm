	animals. He was revered as a fierce warrior capable of fighting a platoon of men by himself, but also as a kind soul for the records of his dealings with other tribes show \
	understanding and kindness. He is upheld to be the ultimate Tajara- powerful, wise, and magnanimous. Followers of Mata'ke himself endeavor to emulate his grandeur, while others \
