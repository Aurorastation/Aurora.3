	name = RELIGION_HIVEPANTHEON
	description = "Hive pantheons are the most prominent religion amongst Vaurca. To put simply, it would be the veneration of a Hives own Queen and Lesser Queens. Not unlike deities, \
	Vaurca commonly beseech their queen for guidance, or in shock. To their credit, and whether they are aware of it or not, The Queens themselves may believe in this faith too. All \
	Vaurca of this faith call Virtual Reality the Aether and often view it as a literal heaven, created by each Queen and Lesser Queen to house the souls of their progeny. It is the \
	belief of adherents to this doctrine that every Queen, greater or lesser work in a kind of Hive pantheon that ultimately serves to continue the Hives existence."

	name = RELIGION_PREIMMINENNCE
	description = "The faith of the Preimminent Goddess is another religion that is relatively uncommon to find amongst Vaurca populations. Unlike the Hive Pantheon, adherents to this \
	faith believe that God, or Goddess, does not exist but could exist, should all parts of themselves align in their predestined roles. They believe that all members of a Hive or in \
	some cases, several Hives or aliens are pieces of a greater entity that would be god. "

	name = RELIGION_PILOTDREAM
	description = "The newest major religion amongst Vaurca, Pilot Dream Theory, or Simulation Theory believes that all things that exist in the universe are simulations. They believe \
	that reality itself is holographic, using the hidden information of particles to hide simulated interactions that would otherwise reveal the simulation to the simulated beings. \
	They believe that the universe beyond this simulated universe may also itself be simulated, a factor of information compression that follows an infinite algorithmic scale only \
	dependant on how much-observed information must be observed at any single moment."
