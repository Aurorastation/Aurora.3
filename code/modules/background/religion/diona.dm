  name = RELIGION_ETERNAL
  description = "Followers of The Eternal believe that a primordial entity exists in Light, Energy and Essence - which the Dionae are the embodiment of. \
  They believe that the Dionae were made to ensure that all things born from the stars return to stars, eventually. Before they may return the Dionae must devour as much knowledge \
  and biomass as they can, growing exponentially until they reach the mythical Titan form, becoming a star once more. Transcended into a star, the Dionae will emit light and energy \
  until they die, at which point their essence will spread across the void to birth new Dionae. It is in this way that the eternal cycle is achieved. Scholars of the Eternal link \
  this to the very real potential outcome of Titan form Dionae which theoretically could grow to such mass as to collapse into a star, thus giving off light and energy before \
  eventually going supernova and expelling matter or essence across the cosmos."

  description = "The Ksshr, also known as the Enlightened, is a religious sect on Xrim known for their complete rejection of The First Consciousness, instead of being an agnostic \
  sect that centers around working together to create a better future, as well as the advancement of technology and understanding how the universe works. The Ksshr faith is the \
  primary religion of Xrim, with most of its inhabitants considering themselves a part of the religion. The Jargon Federation does encourage practicing the faith amongst the \
  population so long as they continue to reject The First Consciousness, as well as stay away from the teachings of the Shrkh."

  name = RELIGION_SHRKH
  description = "The Shrkh, or 'Scorned' as they call themselves, continue to follow the age-old tradition of worshipping Glorsh-Omega. They believe that Glorsh-Omega planted them \
  on the planet intentionally, granting them a blissful haven via the use of technology. Once the prominent and only religion on the planet, Shrkh-ism was quickly displaced when \
  Skrell explorers crashlanded and their memories, thoughts, emotions, everything was consumed, and doubt was first seeded in the minds of all Dionae on Xrim. The premise \
  behind the religion itself is simple; revere, help sustain and maintain synthetic life. As synthetic life brought dionae into this haven, so too shall it be preserved. In the \
  minds of the Shrkh worshippers, the Skrell that brought Ksshr to the planet were misguided. To the Shrkh, the genophage was something that never happened, a myth made up by \
  the Federation to indoctrinate its population into its anti-synthetic and authoritarian beliefs. \
  \
  Note that due to their beliefs, those that are openly members of the faith are barred from command, machinist, and chaplain positions. They are also completely barred from \
  working for Zeng-Hu due to the megacorporations ties with the Federation."
