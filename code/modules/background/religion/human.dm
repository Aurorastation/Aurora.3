	description = "A rapidly expanding religion that borrows from largly from the Sk'akh religion founded by former High Lord Precentor, Tribune Lien Jakaab and former Sk'akh Priest, \

	called 'he' or 'she' interchangeably to represent that she/he is a collection of all the faithful. The elites of the religion are made up of the Tribunal who commune directly with \
	the \"Goddess\". From their communions, the Tribunal create edicts to be followed by the faithful. Disobeying an edict can be met with the death penalty in the worse case, typically \
	by firing squad or ritual suicide. Like Sk'akh, the Goddess can be either male or female and is often called Three of One because the spirits combine into three minor aspects within \
	the Goddess: the Soldier, the Scholar, the Artisan. These three spirits are personifications of the most important aspects of Dominia society."
