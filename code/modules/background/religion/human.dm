	female supreme being known commonly as 'Goddess' in all languages. The elites of the religion are made up of the Tribunal members that commune directly with the Goddess. \
	From their communions, the Tribunal create edicts to be followed by the faithful. Disobeying an edict can be met with the death penalty in the worse case, typically \
	by firing squad or ritual suicide. It is rumored by the faithful that the Tribunal possess psionic powers gifted to them by the Goddess. The Goddess is often called \
	Three of One due to her three minor aspects: the Soldier, the Scholar, the Artisan. These three spirits are personifications of the most important aspects of Dominia society. \
	Tribunal priests agree that all three are equally important, and that malign spirits can be attracted by an imbalance in the Great Three. Priests often stress the importance \
	of balance, both in matters of spirit, in society, and in personal life."
