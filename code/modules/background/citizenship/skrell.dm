	description = "Home of the Skrell, a centralized union of solar systems run by councilors of different ranks and positions. The capital of the Federation is located at the city of \
	Kal'lo on the core planet Jargon IV, also known as Querrbalak, within the Jargon system. While the majority of Skrell live within the Jargon Federation, a sizable portion live in \
	independent nations within the Traverse, or abroad. The quality of life within Federation is considered to be the best in the galaxy (due in part to their technological advances \
	and the availability of both C'thur and Dionaea as manual labourers), allowing Federation Citizens to focus on less intensive pursuits. A rogue artificial intelligence, \
	Glorsh-Omega, has traumatized this nation for centuries to come, and the Federation is very wary of humanity, who has acquired AI technology (such as IPCs) after a Federation \
	tech leak."
