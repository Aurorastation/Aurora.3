	Kal'lo on the core planet Nralakk IV, also known as Qerrbalak, within the Nralakk system. While the majority of Skrell live within the Nralakk Federation, a sizable portion live \
	abroad. The quality of life within Federation is considered to be the best in the galaxy due to their technological advances, allowing Federation Citizens access to a quality of \
	life almost unmatched anywhere else in the Spur. \
	A rogue artificial intelligence, Glorsh-Omega, has traumatized this nation for centuries to come. The Federation is very wary of humanity, who has acquired AI technology \
	after a Federation tech leak provided them with the research required to create their own AI, as well as allowing them to create IPCs."
