	Under Overlords land on planets are divided between Lords, with the rest of the feudal hierarchy being beneath them. The Clan system is deeply entrenched in Unathi society, \
	with everything else revolving around it. It forms a major part of their code of honor, which stresses the importance of martial abilities and loyalty to the Clan. Despite an \
	apocalyptic world war that nearly plunged the species into ruin, the Izweski Hegemony has rebounded and is currently working on making the Hegemony a galactic power."
