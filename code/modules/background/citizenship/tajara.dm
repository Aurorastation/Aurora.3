	government of Adhomai. It claims to be the true keeper of Al'marii's legacy. However, the PRA can be described as a Hadiist branch of Al'marii's revolutionary ideology - that means \
	putting the State at the top of a hierarchy of power. The PRA is a very centralized state, but in recent years has slowly been able to start making true its promises to bring \
	revolution to the masses. With land reform, enfranchisement of women and peasantry, literacy initiatives, and the collectivization of farms and the means of production, the PRA is \
	struggling to hold true to its radical ideals while an entrenched upper party stubbornly tries to hold onto power."
