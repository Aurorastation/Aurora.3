	government of Adhomai. It claims to be the true keeper of Al'mari's legacy. However, the PRA can be described as a Hadiist branch of Al'mari's revolutionary ideology - that means \
	putting the State at the top of a hierarchy of power. The PRA is a very centralized state, but in recent years has slowly been able to start making true its promises to bring \
	revolution to the masses. With land reform, enfranchisement of women and peasantry, literacy initiatives, and the collectivization of farms and the means of production, the PRA is \
	struggling to hold true to its radical ideals while an entrenched upper party stubbornly tries to hold onto power."

	to \"free Tajara from the new shackles imposed upon them by the corporate overlords and return Adhomai to a free, prosperous planet like our ancestors dreamed of.\" They named the \

	insurgency movement, then an organized military, into a modern, democratic nation. With the help of Nated as a government minister going out to negotiate with ruling Juntas to \

	line that survived the previous Revolution by remaining in hiding, owing to the efforts of their supporters. Founded by King Vahzirthaamro Azunja specifically, he denounces both other \
	factions in the civil war as illegitimate and himself as the only legitimate ruler of Adhomai. Supporters of the New Kingdom tend to be rare outside lands it controls. However, \
	they believe strongly that the current republic on Adhomai was founded on genocide and unspeakable slaughters. The New Kingdom puts forth the ideology that Republicanism is \
	bloodshed. The only way to return Adhomai to peace and prosperity is to learn from the mistakes of the ancient nobles and Republicans, and create a new noble dynasty. They believe \
	this dynasty should rule as a constitutional monarchy in order to prevent abuses of power. In reality, this has proven very difficult, especially with the realities of war. \
	The lofty titles of the nobles disguise the fact that most of the nobility of this new kingdom remain in squalor only marginally better than the peasants. Life is difficult, and \
	the Azunja dynasty finds itself struggling to function with their limited constitutional powers and factional in-fighting between the military and the civilian government."
