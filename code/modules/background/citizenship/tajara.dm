	putting the State at the top of a hierarchy of power. The PRA is a very centralized state, but in recent years has slowly been able to start making true its promises to bring \
	revolution to the masses. With land reform, enfranchisement of women and peasantry, literacy initiatives, and the collectivization of farms and the means of production, the PRA is \
	struggling to hold true to its radical ideals while an entrenched upper party stubbornly tries to hold onto power."

	description = "The last major faction is the rebellious New Kingdom of Adhomai, which seceded and declared itself a nation in 2450. The New Kingdom is ruled by a Njarir'Akhran noble \
	line that survived the previous Revolution by remaining in hiding, owing to the efforts of their supporters. Ruled by King Vahzirthaamro Azunja specifically, he denounces both other \
	factions in the civil war as illegitimate and himself as the only legitimate ruler of Adhomai. Supporters of the New Kingdom tend to be rare outside lands it controls. However, \
	they believe strongly that the current republic on Adhomai was founded on genocide and unspeakable slaughters. The New Kingdom puts forth the ideology that Republicanism is \
	bloodshed. The only way to return Adhomai to peace and prosperity is to learn from the mistakes of the ancient nobles and Republicans, and create a new noble dynasty. They believe \
	this dynasty should rule as a constitutional monarchy in order to prevent abuses of power. In reality, this has proven very difficult, especially with the realities of war. \
	The lofty titles of the nobles disguise the fact that most of the nobility of this new kingdom remain in squalor only marginally better than the peasants. Life is difficult, and \
	the Azunja dynasty finds itself struggling to function with their limited constitutional powers and factional in-fighting between the military and the civilian government."
