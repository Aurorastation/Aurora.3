	to as EUM, is a habitable world home to multiple Dionae civilizations and clusters. While not the homeworld \
	of the species, EUM is the largest-known world to have been colonized exclusively by Dionae without contact \
	or help from outside species, being home to the Dionae for thousands of years prior to discovery."
