Following the 2388 Uprising where a reactor meltdown led to the ship crashing into an asteroid, all but the Dionae prisoners aboard survived. Over the past century, the ship has been reclaimed and rebuilt by these Dionae who have formed their own, rigid culture spearheaded by one visionary leader. Working under Hephaestus Industries and with trade agreements with the Coalition of Colonies, the Narrows is one of the largest metals and alloys exporter in Coalition space - an image the Narrows strives to preserve. 'Majors' of the Narrows value order, following a strict hierarchy known as the Octaves System, and are separated by Blocks which dictate their duties. The Iron Eternal has a strong presence aboard the Narrows."
