However, the law does not reflect the popular opinion towards synthetics, with many Elyrans today viewing them as not equal to humans. Still, IPC in the Republic enjoy the ability to become citizens and receive social welfare, with a lucky minority finding a comfortable, if secluded life within the nation."

	desc = "Elyra granting citizenship to a large number of IPC was, at its base, a purely political and eventually unpopular move. Since then, citizenship has proven difficult to obtain for many synthetics, the majority remaining owned privately or by a corporation. A largely isolationist Elyran society has managed to infuse its cultural identity into the majority of free IPC, though there are those who choose to abstain from the mainstream and politics to turn to the arts."
	important_information = "All IPC in Elyra are produced within the Republic, foreign IPC being mistrusted and oftentimes prohibited from entry, let alone citizenship and residency. All Elyran manufactured IPC are expected to have at least a basic knowledge of the cultural norms of Elyra and tenets of Islam."
