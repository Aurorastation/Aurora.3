Since then, citizenship has proven difficult to obtain for many synthetics, the majority remaining owned privately or by a corporation. A largely isolationist Elyran society has managed to infuse its cultural identity into the majority of free IPC, though there are those who choose to abstain from the mainstream and politics to turn to the arts."
