IPC have been granted rights to self ownership and even citizenship, complete with property and a bid in the corporate job market. However, a great number remain in impoverished conditions in the slums of District 14 of Mendell City, while the majority of synthetics are still owned under conditions similar to those of the Alliance. New Gibson similarly hosts a number of IPC as a point of entry into the wider Tau Ceti system and the Republic at large. While the cold weather may provide for a comfortable stay, the negative attitude of the human population towards synthetics has forced many to adopt a more closed and stoic outlook, tending to keep to themselves."
