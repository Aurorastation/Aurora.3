This phoron has made the Republic extremely wealthy and has given them a technological edge over much of the Spur. Highly-controlled customs and harsh immigration requirements have kept much of Elyra isolated from the broader Spur, and have led to the growth of a large population of \"Non-Citizen Persons,\" that reside in the Republic. Recent attacks by the Lii'dra hive of the vaurca have led to the Republic becoming increasingly militarized."

This is enforceable by server moderators and admins."

The environment outside of Medina's floating cities is extremely hazardous due to unpredictable tectonic activity, which has led to bounties being placed for phoron extraction and presented to non-Elyran citizens in order to ensure that Elyran citizens do not end up dead.
