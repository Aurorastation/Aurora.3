Imperial society is sharply divided between Morozians, which are themselves divided between noble Primaries and commoner Secondaries, and Ma'zals, which make up the population of its conquered worlds. Militaristic and expansionist, the Empire has been increasingly brought into conflict with its neighbors: the Serene Republic of Elyra and Coalition of Colonies.

Much of the wealth of Dominians living in the Imperial Core has been built off of resources extracted from worlds conquered by the Empire.
