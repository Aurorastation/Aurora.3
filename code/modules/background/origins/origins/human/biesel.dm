Since its inception, it has continued to evolve, especially with the recent expansion of the Republic of Biesel into the Solarian Alliance's Outer Ring after its abandonment during the collapse. Despite its recent acquisition, the Corporate Reconstruction Zone as it is now known has begun adjusting and blending their own cultures into the Biesellite way of life, those not bending the knee and aligning are often bastions of insurgency and unrest."

There exists no singular culture, but instead, a loose melting pot of multiculturalism exists where the only definable trait of Biesellite culture is that it doesn't have any. Most of Tau Ceti's inhabitants reside within Mendell City, a large metropolis that stretches across the plains of Biesel, and has various districts each with its own culture."
