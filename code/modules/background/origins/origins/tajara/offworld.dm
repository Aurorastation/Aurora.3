While notable communities existed in the Sol Alliance, they were dissolved following growing hostility against them. Due to the recent migrations and government influence, no major difference exists between the Adhomian and Off-World cultures. However, as the Tajaran communities grow, their peculiarities begin to take a more important role in their identity."

	desc = "The Free Tajaran Council is the largest Tajaran community in Himeo. Its origins can be traced back to the First Revolution-era revolutionaries that fled Adhomai. The Free Council culture is the traditional Northern Ras'nrr way of life heavily influenced by the Council's ideology, the situation in Himeo, and the past isolation from the wide Tajaran community. A great emphasis is put on the collective and the survival of the society above the individual. Himean Tajara will usually have an aversion to strict chains of command, preferring to make decisions based on common consensus instead of relying on a leader. Diligence and modesty are considered virtues that every Tajara should strive for. While not necessarily xenophobic, the Free Council Tajara are highly suspicious of outsiders and will take more time to establish bonds with people from outside of their communities."

Because of its relatively short existence, discrimination, and other barriers present in Tau Ceti, the Tajara of Little Adhomai still clings to their native culture. Even the few individuals born here carry a great Adhomian influence, usually identifying themselves with their family's origins. Despite this influence, District Six is also home to its own cultural expressions."
