Formed by a group of scientists and engineers on Ouerea after the Contact War, they took the Th'akh faith to extremes through ritualistic augmentation in the pursuit of self-actualization. After revealing themselves to the galaxy, these transhumanists seek to carve out a small space for themselves wherever they can seek refuge. Many disabled and elderly form these religious communes that seize and control their own spiritual destiny, and others who feel displaced by society - Guwan, those who claim their bodies and souls do not align, and even those of other species - they are found within these communes as well."

These communes are often heavily guarded by Aut'akh warriors set on keeping these people safe, and because of the possible danger of attacking these communes, they rarely see attack. It is not unheard of, though; whole communes have been arrested by city garrisons or lynched by mobs led by nobles."

A few years is all it took for a community of Aut'akh to grow, walling off the Factory and setting up a safe spot for them to fit. Over time, the surrounding local dreg community came to accept the Aut'akh in. Even still, some have treated the augmented Unathi as just another gang they have to deal with."

Similar to the Factory commune on Eridani I, the Razortail Enclave is stuck in the poorer regions of the city, trapped there by a lack of wealth and a conviction to not stray too far from their ideals; however, unlike their sister commune, these sinta do not ignore the gang conflicts of the streets, and often themselves get involved to prevent their rank from kidnappings and having their prosthetics stripped from them — a barbaric practice in the eyes of these fanatics."
