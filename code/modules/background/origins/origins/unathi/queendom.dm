Led by the elderly Queen Lazak Szek’Hakh alongside her daughters, Zasza and Tzansa. Though the Wasteland has made resources within the previously lush region somewhat scarce, the Queendom manages to teeter between thriving and surviving thanks to the extensive aquaculture industry that exists within the capital of Yu’kal – expanded upon by Queen Lazak following the death of her husband during the Contact War."
