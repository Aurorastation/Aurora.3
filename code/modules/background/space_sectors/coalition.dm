	description = "Sparsely inhabited, Weeping Stars has become a monument to the atrocities commited during the Great Interstellar War. Dozens and dozens of planets bare their trauma for all to see; craters litter their surfaces and destroyed cities encapsulate the ruins of what was once likely a promising colony. Though previously a neutral zone, it has since been recaptured by the Coalition of Colonies following the collapse of the Solarian Alliance."
