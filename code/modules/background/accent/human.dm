	description = "The typical Elyran accent is a relatively nondescript affair, typically sticking close to the accepted dictionary norms of pronunciation. The standard language \

	For those unfortunate individuals born outside Eridani's shining skyscrapers and silver spires, the distinctly uncorporate flow of \"dreg\" speech can make attaining \
	the standard Eridanian accent almost impossible to fully achieve. The curious middle-ground accent of the so-called \"reinstated\" in Eridani society allows an individual \

	Speaking with this accent in the proximity of most humans is a surefire way to gain their suspicion, and those speaking with this accent often find themselves under \
