/datum/accent/coc
	name = ACCENT_COC
	description = "The frontier is home to an unknowably vast amount of humans and settlements, covering everything from small outposts of only a few hundred to major planets such as \
	Xanu Prime. The Frontiersfolk are as diverse as their accents are, but the most common \"frontier accent\" is generally regarded as that of Xanu Prime - the arguable capital of \
	the massive Coalition of Colonies."

/datum/accent/elyra
	name = ACCENT_ELYRA
	description = "The typical Elyran accent is an odd combination of Tau Ceti Basic and Sol Common due to the Republic's independence from the Sol Alliance. The standard language \
	of the Republic of Elyra is Elyran Common, a variation upon standard Sol Common that is closer to Tau Ceti Basic than other Sol Common dialects."

/datum/accent/eridani
	name = ACCENT_ERIDANI
	description = "The accent of Eridanian \"suits\" is almost universally looked upon as the accent of corporate excellence throughout the Sol Alliance and Republic of Biesel. \
	Speaking with this accent is a surefire way to get one's foot into the door in the corporate world, and wealthier Suits often devote time and resources to refining their \
	accent to be more properly Eridanian."

	name = ACCENT_ERIDANIDREG
	description = "The Eridanian \"dreg\" accent is almost universally looked upon as the accent of petty criminals and ne'er-do-wells throughout the Orion Spur. \
	Speaking with this accent in the proximity of most humans is a surefire way to gain their suspicion, and those speaking with this accent often find themselves under \
	enhanced security surveillance in corporate facilities. Eagle Corp, one of the major employers of dregs in Eridani, devotes a significant amount of its training \
	to making its dreg recruits drop this distinctive accent."

/datum/accent/sol
	name = ACCENT_SOL
	description = "The typical Solarian accent has a hundred tiny variants and can be found on a multitude of planets in countless systems, and is often simply regarded \

/datum/accent/scarab
	name = ACCENT_SCARAB
	description = "The common accent of the Scarab Fleet has dozens, perhaps hundreds, of small variations due to the Fleet itself being spread throughout a massive number of \

/datum/accent/silversun
	name = ACCENT_SILVERSUN
	description = "The native accent of Silversun is a sing-songy take on standard Sol Common that has, since massive investment into the planet by Idris Incorporated, come to be \
	associated with the planet's renowned tourism industry. Many native residents of Silversun are bitter that their accent - and planet - are seen as nothing more than an enormous \
	vacation retreat by the greater Orion Spur."

/datum/accent/phong
	name = ACCENT_PHONG
	description = "New Hai Phongese Common is, compared to the typical Sol Common accent, much more tonal. This has lent it a distinctive accent that is easy to tell apart from the \
	standard Sol Common accent associated with the Solarian core worlds. Due to the hazardous environmental conditions present on New Hai Phong, many residents of New Hai Phong \
	carry another distinctive auditory cue: coughing and wheezing due to asthma."
	tag_icon = "new_hai_phong"

/datum/accent/mars
	name = ACCENT_MARTIAN
	description = "Martian Common is a more guttural form of Sol Common that borrows some elements of Freespeak. The distinctive accent is, as a result, looked down upon as \
	a \"hick\" dialect on Luna and Venus and regarded as the dialect of quarrelsome and annoying Martians elsewhere. Some Martians go to great lengths to hide their accents due to \
	this reputation, which is still alive in the Republic of Biesel despite its separation from the greater Sol Alliance."
	tag_icon = "mars"

/datum/accent/luna
	name = ACCENT_LUNA
	description = "The Lunarian accent is regarded throughout the Sol Alliance, and beyond, as a distinctive mark of being Lunarian. The accent is extremely hard for immigrants to Luna \
	to pick up and replicate, and is carefully maintained by Lunarians abroad to keep their accent distinct. Many Idris Incorporated IPCs are programmed with Lunarian accents to make \
	them seem high-class in both appearance and in accent."

/datum/accent/gibson
	name = ACCENT_GIBSON
	description = "The New Gibsoner accent is very close to the accent of Tau Ceti proper, due to the nature of the planet's colonization. However, New Gibsoners are known for talking \

	tag_icon = "gibson"

/datum/accent/konyang
	name = ACCENT_KONYAN
	description = "The Konyanger Common accent is quite similar to standard Sol Common, but has drawn some influence from Freespeak due to Konyang's position near the border between \
	the Sol Alliance and the Coalition of Colonies. A significant amount of IPCs possess a Konyanger accent, due to the planet being the origin of IPCs and a major producer of them."

/datum/accent/himeo
	name = ACCENT_HIMEO
	description = "Himean Common is more guttural and harsh-sounding than the typical Sol Common accent, due to Himeo's position in the Coalition of Colonies. The Himean accent and its \
	distinctive guttural method of speaking are easily distinguishable from other Sol Common speakers, even when speaking Tau Ceti Basic or Freespeak. Himean Common has the unusual \
	reputation of making its speaker always sound angry, no matter the speaker's mood, due to its more guttural nature."

/datum/accent/vysoka
	name = ACCENT_VYSOKA
	description = "The typical Vyoskan accent is regarded as a throatier and harsher variation of Freespeak, with the planetary accent possessing many harsh tones. Some non-Vysokans have \
	noted that the accent sounds similar to Himean Common at times, due to both accents being more guttural than average. However, the Vysokan accent remains distinctive from Himean \
	Common due to its roots in Freespeak rather than Sol Common."

/datum/accent/venus
	name = ACCENT_VENUS
	description = "Venusian Common (referred time as Cytherean Common on Venus itself) is often regarded as the \"most common\" form of Sol Common due to the prevalence of its entertainment \

/datum/accent/venusjin

	description = "Jintarian Common is looked down upon on Venus itself for its association with Venusian surfacers, and is often used by the planet's entertainment industry to mark a \

/datum/accent/dominia
	name = ACCENT_DOMINIA
	description = "The most common Dominian accent is Vulgar Morozi, a variation of Sol Common found upon Moroz itself. Dominion-spoken Sol Common and Tau Ceti Basic are both heavily \
	influenced by Tradeband, the common language of both human and unathi nobility in the Empire. Vulgar Morozi has regional variations on the colonies of the Dominian Empire, and in \
	the rebellious Morozian region of Fisanduh. The Fisanduhian accent is considered to be a distinctive higher-pitched variation of Vulgar Morozi that is often suppressed by insurgents \
	to better blend in with the greater Imperial population."

/datum/accent/jupiter
	name = ACCENT_JUPITER
	description = "The Jovian accent is an odd mish-mash of accents from Jupiter's various moons, and has heavy variation on each of the moons. On Idris Incorporated-dominated Europa, \
	the Jovian accent often takes on traces of Tradeband due to the amount of high-income tourism, while the Castillean Jovian accent is known for the rapid, breathless pace at which it \
	is typically spoken. Ganymede is often seen as the \"standard\" Jovian accent, though some on Castillo vehemently believe that the Castillian accent should be the standard."

/datum/accent/europa
	name = ACCENT_EUROPA
	description = "Europans are known to be much quieter and speak at a slower pace than their counterparts on Callisto, despite the close proximity of the two moons. Solarian linguists have \
	traced the whisper-like nature of the accent origins to the planet's submarines: crews believed that quieter voices interfered less with sonar, and were less likely to be heard by whatever was \
	outside the hull. Europans that have succumbed to \"Deep Crazy\", a psychological phenomenon found on the moon, are known to abandon the typically hushed nature of Europan speech for screaming hysterically."

/datum/accent/earth

	description = "The typical Earth, or Terran, accent of the modern era has its roots in Mandarin Chinese, the dominant language of Earth for much of its modern history. All accents found in human space - \

	name = ACCENT_DEEPFRONTIER
	description = "The so-called \"Deep Frontier\" accent is not truly a unified accent at all, and instead defines a broad range of accents from the more \"wild\" frontier outside of human control. \
	Those with these accents are almost universally looked down upon as wild savages by their counterparts in more civilized space at best. Speakers of this accent are almost always found in lower-end \

	The accent is higher pitched than its Dominian counterpart, and has been described as more tonal. Members of the Fisanduh Freedom Front will often go to great lengths to disguise this accent, \

/datum/accent/gadpathur
	name = ACCENT_GADPATHUR
	description = "The Gadpathurian accent, otherwise known as Gadpathurian Common, is an older dialect of Sol Common that is often regarded as dated-sounding by other speakers due to the \
	isolation of the planet during its period of reunification. Due to the government's tight control over Gadpathur, and push for unity in the face of the Sol Alliance, Gadpathurians have \
	been described as sounding relatively similar no matter which area of the planet they hail from."
