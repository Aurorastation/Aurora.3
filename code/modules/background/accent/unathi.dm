	description = "The Noble Hegemonic accent is eloquent and flowing, staying near the front of the mouth. Airy and filled with hissing, this accent requires birth-right or years of \
	practice to properly convey. The families of Lords, Sk'akh Priests, noble warriors, and some merchants will often share this accent, and will mostly find the Sinta'Azaziba language \
	and Traditionalist accent more savage. The Noble Hegemonic accent is primarily found in the Untouched Lands, and originates from the Sinta'Unathi language."

	description = "A more guttural, droning accent - although one that would demand respect on Moghes before the Contact War, and still demands it in the Wasteland. Primarily born from the \
	guttural intonations and physical movement required to communicate in Sinta'Azaziba, this Noble Traditional accent requires clan-training from a family member or shaman - and as \

	description = "Deep within the Wasteland, the most savage lands dominated by bandits, death cults, and nomadic peoples that have lost any connection to their ancestors culturally. \
	The Deep Wasteland accent comes from a disconnection to original talking styles, and adds in more aggressive speech patterns. To both Hegemonic and Traditionalist, the Deep \
	Wastelander accent is the sign of an individual who has grown up without a home or clan that could have taught them an ancestral dialect. The accent is apparent in both \
	Sinta'Unathi and Sinta'Azaziba."
