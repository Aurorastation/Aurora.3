	description = "The Noble Hegemonic accent is eloquent and flowing, staying near the front of the mouth. Airy and filled with hissing, this accent requires birth-right or years of \
	practice to properly convey. The families of Lords, Sk'akh Priests, noble warriors, and some merchants will often share this accent, and will mostly find the Sinta'Azaziba language \
	and Traditionalist accent more savage. The Noble Hegemonic accent is primarily found in the Untouched Lands, and originates from the Sinta'Unathi language."

	description = "A more guttural, droning accent - although one that would demand respect on Moghes before the Contact War, and still demands it in the Wasteland. Primarily born from the \
	guttural intonations and physical movement required to communicate in Sinta'Azaziba, this Noble Traditional accent requires clan-training from a family member or shaman - and has \

	Although filled with variety due to the multitude of kingdoms composed in the Wasteland, the borders of where these accents used to be set no longer exist and have simply become \

	description = "Deep within the Wasteland, the most savage lands dominated by bandits, death cults, and nomadic peoples that have lost any connection to their ancestors culturally. \
	The Deep Wasteland accent comes from a disconnection to original talking styles, and adds in more aggressive speech patterns. To both Hegemonic and Traditionalist, the Deep \
	Wastelander accent is the sign of an individual who has grown up without a home or clan that could have taught them an ancestral dialect. The accent is apparent in both \
	Sinta'Unathi and Sinta'Azaziba."
