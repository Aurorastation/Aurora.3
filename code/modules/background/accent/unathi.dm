	description = "The Noble Hegemonic accent is eloquent and flowing, staying near the front of the mouth. Airy and filled with hissing, this accent requires birth-right or years of \
	practice to properly convey. The families of Lords, Sk'akh Priests, noble warriors, and some merchants will often share this accent, and will mostly find the Sinta'Azaziba language \
	and Traditionalist accent more savage. The Noble Hegemonic accent is primarily found in the Untouched Lands, and originates from the Sinta'Unathi language."

	description = "Lowborn guilds-workers, first-generation merchants, simple warrior levymen, and hundreds of other tasks for the common Clans - this is the most common accent for \
	Unathi, stereotypically. It still holds a slight air of royalty to it compared to the Traditional accents. It is most commonly found in the crowded Untouched Lands and in colonies. \
	It originates from the Sinta'Unathi language. "

	description = "A more guttural, droning accent - although one that would demand respect on Moghes before the Contact War, and still demands it in the Wasteland. Primarily born from the \
	guttural intonations and physical movement required to communicate in Sinta'Azaziba, this Noble Traditional accent requires clan-training from a family member or shaman - and has \
	become either a sign of survival or defeat to most who see this ancient accent fading from existence."

	description = "Primarily derived from the guttural intonations and physical movement of Sinta'Azaziba, common Unathi from the Wasteland would have this grittier speech pattern. \
	Although filled with variety due to the multitude of kingdoms composed in the Wasteland, the borders of where these accents used to be set no longer exist and have simply become \
	what it is now, struggling to find identity."
