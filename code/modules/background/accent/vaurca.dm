    description = "Zo'rane is the modern day dialect of the Zo'ra hive, composed of buzzing, cheap bisellite voice modulators that manage to sway most voices \
    into a more gender neutral tone, while retaining a distinct alien dialect. To other vaurcae, this accent is reminiscent of the authority the Zo'ra held - \
    regal and noble. Their vocal augments stereotypically have difficulty, typically when producing sounds related to the letter 's', instead substituting with \
    a harsh buzzing in the throat."

    description = "K'laxane is the modern day dialect of the K'lax hive. Primitive modulators, even among K'lax standards, manage to capture a similarity to the \
    peasantry of the Izweski Hegemony on Moghes - however, they do not fully replicate it, retaining a more drawn out and dreamy tone. To other vaurcae, this is \
    a more subservient manner of speaking, akin to how Bound tend to draw out their thoughts - a common trait instilled in most vassal hives as a brand. Their \
    vocal augments stereotypically have difficulty, typically when producing sounds related to the letter 's', instead substituting with a harsh buzzing in the \
    throat - the K'lax experience less of this - no Unathi would be content listening to a Vaura buzz incessantly when trying to hiss a sentence in the \
    Hegemonic tongue."

    description = "C'thuric is the modern day dialect of the C'thur hive, a sly and sneering take on the unyielding Nral'Malic. Modulators are unfortunately \
    still cheap, capturing a very monotone and unchanging method of speaking. Voices are warped into being clear and concise, many C'thur adopting a blunt and \
    to-the-point method of speaking - yet, when needed to be verbose, delivery is often swift and intelligible. Other vaurcae would recognize this tone as being \
    infamous of the C'thur's past deeds. Their vocal augments stereotypically have difficulty, typically when producing sounds related to the letter 's', instead \
    substituting with a harsh buzzing in the throat."
