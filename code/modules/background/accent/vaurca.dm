    description = "Zo'rane is the modern day dialect of the Zo'ra Hive, composed of cheap Biesellite voice modulators that manage to sway most voices \
    into a more gender neutral tone, while retaining a distinct alien dialect. To other Vaurcae, this accent is reminiscent of the authority the Zo'ra held - \
    regal and noble. Their vocal augments stereotypically have difficulty, typically when producing sounds related to the letter 's', instead substituting with \

    description = "K'laxane is the modern day dialect of the K'lax Hive. Primitive modulators manage to capture a similarity to the \
    peasantry of the Izweski Hegemony on Moghes - however, they do not fully replicate it, retaining a more drawn out and dreamy tone. To other Vaurcae, this is \
    a more subservient manner of speaking, akin to how Bound tend to draw out their thoughts - a common trait instilled in most vassal hives as a brand. Their \
    vocal augments stereotypically have difficulty, typically when producing sounds related to the letter 's', instead substituting with a harsh buzzing in the \
    throat - the K'lax experience less of this - no Unathi would be content listening to a Vaurca buzz incessantly when trying to hiss a sentence in the \
    Hegemonic tongue."

	C'thur's infamous past deeds. Modulators are unfortunately still cheap, leading to a monotone method of speaking. \
	Voices are also warped into being clear and concise, many C'thur adopting a blunt and to-the-point style when speaking casually. \

    description = "The Lii'dra speech, as understood by those that have heard the Hivemind and live to tell, is characterized by a monotonous voice that sounds \
    even more robotic than the modulators used by other Hives. It is believed to be a modified technology reverse engineered from stolen \
    Zo'rane modulators. While, with its flaws, the Zo'ra accent might sound quirky to some, it is often said that this is to add more personality to each \
    individual. Since the Lii'dra do not think of themselves as individuals, these variations were deemed useless. The Connected will often speak of themselves in plural, while the Disconnected \
    are prone to using the first person when referring to others."
