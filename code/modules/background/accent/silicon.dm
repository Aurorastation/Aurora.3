Sounding somewhat like a symphony and speech coalescing in a scenic pattern to make something literally 'music to one's ears'. This accent package is known to be exceedingly expensive for something so trivial and is reserved for only those of the Merchant class of the Golden Deep and synthetics above."

	description = "The Thesian accent is a custom made invention from Golden Deep space to represent the more standard members of the collective. A mix between a symphony and the standard 'Text-To-Speech' variation that is found in the other synthetics of the Orion Spur. This voice package is a bit more jarring and is significantly cheaper than its richer Merchant cousin, but brings a vocal identity to its bearer to help one acclimate to a new home within the foreign horizons.
