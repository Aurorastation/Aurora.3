	name = ACCENT_SKRELL
	description = "In the Nralakk Federation, the typical skrellian accent has dozens of minute variations and can be found across a multitude of planets (and their colonies). \

/datum/accent/skrell/homeworld
	name = ACCENT_HOMEWORLD
	description = "The typical accent of the Homeworld (or Qerrbalak) is very distinct for being much more enunciated than other variations of Nral'Malic. It puts specific emphasis on a \

	name = ACCENT_QERRMALIC
	description = "The Qerr'Malic accent is known for being rather soft, even hushed at some points. Because of the moon's tourist industry, it borrows elements from other accents to \
	form a unique mixture designed to emphasize low tones so that the accent is more comfortable to non-Skrell, further cementing the overall 'quietness' to other Skrell as their sentences \
	sound half-finished."

/datum/accent/skrell/aliose
	name = ACCENT_ALIOSE
	description = "It is often noted that those from Aliose have a distinctive shrill to their voices, emphasizing high notes frequently throughout their speech. The Skrell view this \
	as guttural, mostly due to the resonations felt deep within their throats when attempting to replicate the accent."

/datum/accent/skrell/aweiji
	name = ACCENT_AWEIJI
	description = "This type of accent emphasizes a balance of highs and lows. It uses the nasal canal to further produce a harmonic pattern of speech. Idols are often found replicating \
	this accent due to how gentle it is on both Skrell and non-Skrell."

	name = ACCENT_GENNER
	description = "The Generation Fleet accent is actually a catch-all term for the various accents that have developed aboard the Generation Fleets of the Nralakk Federation. \
	As a result of being separated from their planet of origin for generations, these accents don't have much in common with any modern Skrell accent, and are usually \

	name = ACCENT_SKRELLCETI
	description = "While the Biesel accent is easy to pick up by most Tau Ceti Basic speakers, the Biesellite Skrell Standard accent is common in the more insular Skrell communities, \

	name = ACCENT_SKRELLCOC
	description = "Coalition Skrell Standard refers to the various accents of Skrell living within the Coalition of Colonies. Heavily influenced by Freespeak, this accent \
	is more guttural, with lower-pitched tones being more prevalent. The Coalition of Colonies has a reputation for being generally anti-Federation in policy, which has \
	resulted in this accent being seen by Skrell as anti-Federation by association."

	description = "The Tattuqig accent has a slight drawl to it, and is known for the dropping or merging of vowels when speaking. Like many other Traverse accents it has \

/datum/accent/skrell/consortium
	name = ACCENT_SKRELLCONSORTIUM
	description = "The Skrell Consortium Standard accent draws from the accents of migrating Skrell from the Federation as well as elements of rootsong from the local Dionae population, creating a sing-songy accent with \
	melodic highs and lows. The accent has been compared to the Aweijiin accent, but it does not have the same reputation as it is not used by idols."

	description = "Technically categorized as a subvariant referred to as Skrell Venusian Common (or Skrell Solarian-Cytherean-Aweijin Common by Federation linguists \
and simply Skrell Cytherean Common on Venus itself), the accent is one of multiple layers of cultural adaptation. \
Taking roots from the local Skrell Idols (or Skrellian Stars) mimicking an Aweiji accent for its harmonic, balanced range, then added atop Cytherean Common's roots in the \
entertainment industry resulted in a truly chimeric accent of a balanced, consistently energetic lilt that defines the newly-growing Cytherean Skrell population. Some note that the \
lack of extreme highs and lows results in a notably clipped tone when speaking in Nral'malic, requiring the ability to \"switch\" to a more natural sounding Aweiji accent on the fly when switching between."

	name = ACCENT_SKRELLVENUSJIN
	description = "Much like Cytherean Common dominating the image of Venus itself, the working-class Skrell aboard the aerostats are not \
defined by the high life and high tones of Skrell Cytherian Common, instead remaining closer to the original Skrell Solarian Common developed during the first wave of integration \
of the species. Cytherean Skrell look down at this accent as being flat and unappealing in its comparatively plain tones, while Jintarian Skrell look down at their \
Cytherean kin as ridiculous and performative."

/datum/accent/skrell/silversun
	name = ACCENT_SKRELLSILVERSUN
	description = "The Silversun accent is unique in having a linear drift, originally having stronger roots in the Originals' trademark sing-song \
tone that remains present in the newer generation of Skrell born on the planet, while later arrivals absorbed most of the newer Expatriate tone. \
Both groups share a similar, playful sounding tempo that sounds as though the speaker is attempting to sing their sentences, though some tend to reduce it to a subtler lilt."

/datum/accent/skrell/europa
	name = ACCENT_SKRELLEUROPA
	description = "Europan Skrell are notably quieter and speak in slower, gentle tones without the typical warbling and emotional vocalizations, \
emulating their human submarine crew members' own belief of hushed tones warding against what might be beyond the hull from hearing them. Even those working outside of \
the submarines will emulate the tone due to the Nlom carrying the fear and paranoia outside of their work, perpetuating the accent further. \
Skrell who suffer from \"Europan Sea-Blindness\" will take this to the extreme, barely above a murmur as stress and paranoia around what might hear them dominates their thoughts."

Mictlanian Skrell Tradeband to be sluggish and primarily lower in their vocal range, \
