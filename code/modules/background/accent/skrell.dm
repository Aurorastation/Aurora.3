	name = ACCENT_SKRELL
	description = "In the Jargon Federation, the typical skrellian accent has dozens of minute and tiny variations and can be found across a multitude of planets (and their colonies) \
	and in a wide range of sectors. Its generality has resulted in the belief that it is the 'standard' accent for all Skrell. "

/datum/accent/skrell/homeworld
	name = ACCENT_HOMEWORLD
	description = "The typical accent of the Homeworld (or Qerrbalak), is very much more distinct and enunciated than other variations of Nral'Malic. It puts specific emphasis on a \
	melodious manner of speaking, their tones often jumping out of the standard human hearing range."

/datum/accent/skrell/qerrmalic
	name = ACCENT_QERRMALIC
	description = "The Qerr'Malic accent is known for being rather soft, even hushed at some points. Because of the moon's tourist industry, it borrows elements from other accents to \
	form a rather unique mixture that makes specific reference to keeping low tones accessible to non-Skrell, further cementing the overall 'quietness' to other Skrell as their sentences \
	sound half-finished. "

/datum/accent/skrell/aliose
	name = ACCENT_ALIOSE
	description = "It is often noted that those from Aliose have a distinctive shrill to their voices, emphasizing high notes frequently throughout their speech. The Skrell view this \
	as guttural, mostly due to the resonations felt deep within their throats when attempting to replicate the accent."

/datum/accent/skrell/aweiji
	name = ACCENT_AWEIJI
	description = "This type of accent emphasizes on a balance ofhighs and lows. It uses the nasal canal to further produce a harmonic pattern of speech. Idols are often found replicating \
	this accent due to how gentle it is on both Skrell and non-Skrell."

/datum/accent/skrell/traverse
	name = ACCENT_TRAVERSE
	description = "Traverse accents are similar to those of Standard Nral'Malic accents; there are some differences on colonies in the sector, but the general trend of the accent \
	seems to remain within the low ranges, often described as high-pitched and nasal in tone."
