	name = ACCENT_SKRELL
	description = "In the Nralakk Federation, the typical skrellian accent has dozens of minute and tiny variations and can be found across a multitude of planets (and their colonies) \
	and in a wide range of sectors. Its generality has resulted in the belief that it is the 'standard' accent for all Skrell. "

/datum/accent/skrell/homeworld
	name = ACCENT_HOMEWORLD
	description = "The typical accent of the Homeworld (or Qerrbalak), is very much more distinct and enunciated than other variations of Nral'Malic. It puts specific emphasis on a \
	melodious manner of speaking, their tones often jumping out of the standard human hearing range."

/datum/accent/skrell/qerrmalic
	name = ACCENT_QERRMALIC
	description = "The Qerr'Malic accent is known for being rather soft, even hushed at some points. Because of the moon's tourist industry, it borrows elements from other accents to \
	form a rather unique mixture that makes specific reference to keeping low tones accessible to non-Skrell, further cementing the overall 'quietness' to other Skrell as their sentences \
	sound half-finished."

/datum/accent/skrell/aliose
	name = ACCENT_ALIOSE
	description = "It is often noted that those from Aliose have a distinctive shrill to their voices, emphasizing high notes frequently throughout their speech. The Skrell view this \
	as guttural, mostly due to the resonations felt deep within their throats when attempting to replicate the accent."

/datum/accent/skrell/aweiji
	name = ACCENT_AWEIJI
	description = "This type of accent emphasizes on a balance of highs and lows. It uses the nasal canal to further produce a harmonic pattern of speech. Idols are often found replicating \
	this accent due to how gentle it is on both Skrell and non-Skrell."

/datum/accent/skrell/traverse
	name = ACCENT_TRAVERSE
	description = "Traverse accents are similar to those of Standard Nral'Malic accents; there are some differences on colonies in the sector, but the general trend of the accent \

/datum/accent/skrell/genner
	name = ACCENT_GENNER
	description = "The Generation Fleet accent is actually a catch-all term for the various accents that have developed aboard the Generation Fleets of the Nralakk Federation. \
	As a result of being separated from their planet of origin for generations, these accents don't have much in common with any modern Skrell accent, and are usually \
	described as sounding 'older' by other Skrell."

	name = ACCENT_SKRELLCETI
	description = "While the Biesel accent is easy to pick up by most Tau Ceti Basic speakers, the Biesellite Skrell Standard accent is common in the more insular Skrell communities, \
	especially those who are strongly pro-Federation. Biesellite Skrell Standard has many holdovers from Nralakk accents while also having some of the more obvious \
	characteristics of the Biesellite accent."

	name = ACCENT_SKRELLSOL
	description = "Solarian Skrell Standard can be seen as the Skrellian equivalent of the Solarian accent, having hundreds of variants that can be found on planets across \
	the Sol Alliance. The accent has kept the notable tones from accents found in the Federation, while still heavily influenced by the pacing and pronunciation common in the \
	average Solarian accent."

/datum/accent/skrell/coc
	name = ACCENT_SKRELLCOC
	description = "Coalition Skrell Standard refers to the various accents of Skrell living within the Coalition of Colonies. Heavily influenced by Freespeak, this accent \
	is more guttural, with lower-pitched tones being more prevalent. The Coalition of Colonies has a reputation for being generally anti-Federation in policy, which has \
	resulted in this accent being seen by Skrell as anti-Federation by association."

	name = ACCENT_TATTUQIG
	description = "The Tattuqig accent has a slight drawl to it, and is known for the dropping or merging of vowels when speaking. Like many other Traverse accents it has \
	a certain stigma attached to it, and is noted as being 'rural' or 'unrefined' by Skrell from the inner systems."
