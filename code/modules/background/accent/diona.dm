	description = "One of the more peculiar accents spoken by Dionae, Ironsong is notable for not being an accent developed purposefully or through growth conditions, but rather be developed through voice-modulating technology and implants found within Dionae following the Iron Eternal faith. Some variations of the accent do exist, but all under the Ironsong term are distinct for giving the speaker a slightly robotic tone to their speech as if it’s gone through a radio or some form of synthesizer.

While not considered mandatory, many Dionae living in the Federation will adopt the accent due to it being generally more favored by the Federation, often granting those with the accent a higher social credit score."
