	description = "An accent native to the Dionae born within atmospheric conditions, more specifically that of planets. More commonly found in Dionae that were exposed to non-ionising or trace amounts of radiation during their formative years. To non-Dionae, this accent is akin to singing - a high pitched voice that has various rises and falls between soprano and mezzo-soprano."

	description = "An innate accent spoken by Dionae that were born within the vacuum of space, or near extreme amounts of ionising radiation.

	name = ACCENT_IRONSONG
	description = "One of the more peculiar accents spoken by Dionae, Ironsong is notable for not being an accent developed purposefully or through growth conditions, but rather be developed through voice-modulating technology and implants found within Dionae following the Iron Eternal faith. Some variations of the accent do exist, but all under the Ironsong term are distinct for giving the speaker a slightly robotic tone to their speech as if it’s gone through a radio or some form of synthesizer.

/datum/accent/laboursong
	name = ACCENT_LABOURSONG
	description = "An accent unique to Dionae of the Narrows penal vessel. The accent has developed as a result of Narrows dionae restricting their pitch to their octave rank, giving it a very rigid and dull, mono-octave sound, where pronunciation is slow and deliberate. When multiple Narrows dionae come together and speak or sing at once, the accent shines, with beautiful harmonies sounding during their worksongs."

/datum/accent/undersong
	name = ACCENT_UNDERSONG
	description = "Utilized by the Underhive Collective of the Eridani Corporate Federation, Undersong often fails to resonate as strongly as other accents due to the sparse lighting conditions in Dreg settlements where the Underhive resides, leading to poor development."

/datum/accent/hivesong
	name = ACCENT_HIVESONG

//Unathi Influenced Accents
/datum/accent/sandsong
	name = ACCENT_SANDSONG
	description = "Found exclusively in Dionae hailing from the Unathi-Dominated world of Moghes, Sandsong is a distinct variation of Rootsong notable for having its tempo much more drawn out, with tones of higher pitches especially having a much more exaggerated sound.

Much like Sandsong, Dionae with the Wasteland accent will typically carry similar speech patterns to Unathi such as hissing out their S’s."

This accent is similar to Sandsong, though with a greater deal of influence from the accents of Unathi Heartland nobility. Its tempo is faster than that of Sandsong, with a flowing and airy tone lending it a pleasant musicality to non-Dionae ears - which some speculate was deliberately engineered by the Governor of the Viridis to better ingratiate her project to the Hegemony at large."

/datum/accent/wavesong
	name = ACCENT_WAVESONG
	description = "A variant of Rootsong originating from Diona born on Skrellian worlds, Wavesong is considered the general accent for Dionae hailing from the Nralakk Federation. While it shares many similarities with Rootsong, Wavesong sets itself apart by having a lower pitch and more drawn-out tempo in comparison. While not considered mandatory, many Dionae living in the Federation will adopt the accent due to it being generally more favored by the Federation, often granting those with the accent a higher index rating."

Known for it's lighter pitch and tone, along with it's consistent, even pacing for words, the accent is prevalent amongst Nralakk Federation Diona that originate from wild, voidbound gestalts.

	description = "Spoken exclusively by Dionae hailing from the Conglomerated Choir of Nralakk, Starsong is a constructed variation of Sunkensong developed by Federation linguists soon after first contact was made. The accent was purposefully curated to further culturally align the cluster with Skrell and to create closer ties between the two species. Through curated communications and manipulation of blood samples, Starsong is considered a desirable accent by many Dionae in the Federation, furthering the Choir's idol-like status amongst gestalts."

The accent is categorised as almost obnoxious, being louder and higher than other forms of Voidsong in the tenor range, as well as being spoken at a quicker pace, making it difficult to keep up with sometimes - this is believed to be due to Titan's Rapture dionae grappling for attention in such a loud and overwhelming environment."
