	description = "An accent native to the Dionae born within atmospheric conditions, more specifically that of planets. More commonly found in Dionae that were exposed to non-ionising or trace amounts of radiation during their formative years. To non-Dionae, this accent is akin to singing - a high pitched voice that has various rises and falls between soprano and mezzo-soprano."

	description = "One of the more peculiar accents spoken by Dionae, Ironsong is notable for not being an accent developed purposefully or through growth conditions, but rather be developed through voice-modulating technology and implants found within Dionae following the Iron Eternal faith. Some variations of the accent do exist, but all under the Ironsong term are distinct for giving the speaker a slightly robotic tone to their speech as if it’s gone through a radio or some form of synthesizer.

Much like Sandsong, Dionae with the Wasteland accent will typically carry similar speech patterns to Unathi such as hissing out their S’s."

	description = "A variant of Rootsong originating from Diona born on Skrellian worlds, Wavesong is considered the general accent for Dionae hailing from the Nralakk Federation. While it shares many similarities with Rootsong, Wavesong sets itself apart by having a lower pitch and more drawn-out tempo in comparison. While not considered mandatory, many Dionae living in the Federation will adopt the accent due to it being generally more favored by the Federation, often granting those with the accent a higher social credit score."

Known for it's lighter pitch and tone, along with it's consistent, even pacing for words, the accent is prevalent amongst Nralakk Federation Diona that originate from wild, voidbound gestalts.

Through curated communications and manipulation of blood samples, Starsong is considered a desirable accent by many Dionae in the Federation, furthering the Choir's idol-like status amongst gestalts."
