/**
 * This proc is called on a datum on every "cycle" if it is being processed by a subsystem. The time between each cycle is determined by the subsystem's "wait" setting.
 * You can start and stop processing a datum using the START_PROCESSING and STOP_PROCESSING defines.
 *
 * Since the wait setting of a subsystem can be changed at any time, it is important that any rate-of-change that you implement in this proc is multiplied by the seconds_per_tick that is sent as a parameter,
 * Additionally, any "prob" you use in this proc should instead use the SPT_PROB define to make sure that the final probability per second stays the same even if the subsystem's wait is altered.
 * Examples where this must be considered:
 * - Implementing a cooldown timer, use `mytimer -= seconds_per_tick`, not `mytimer -= 1`. This way, `mytimer` will always have the unit of seconds
 * - Damaging a mob, do `L.adjustFireLoss(20 * seconds_per_tick)`, not `L.adjustFireLoss(20)`. This way, the damage per second stays constant even if the wait of the subsystem is changed
 * - Probability of something happening, do `if(SPT_PROB(25, seconds_per_tick))`, not `if(prob(25))`. This way, if the subsystem wait is e.g. lowered, there won't be a higher chance of this event happening per second
 *
 * If you override this do not call parent, as it will return PROCESS_KILL. This is done to prevent objects that dont override process() from staying in the processing list
