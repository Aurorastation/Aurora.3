				<li class="maptweak">Sublevel has received some quality of life improvements for Engineers, predominantly involving Atmospherics, but also with the Tesla and airlocks.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Atmospherics was made larger, now has a large tank for N2O, and was also given a large tank for custom gas mixes. A gas heater was also added alongside the previous gas cooler, an engineering console with remote Air Alarm Control was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things to actually do.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the station on its own, and then some.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks. They were very prone to becoming stuck due to a lack of air, this should help stop that and make using said airlocks more viable.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don't let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>
