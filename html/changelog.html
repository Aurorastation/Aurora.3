				<li class="admin">Varedit now remembers what was in the 'search' field when you click the 'refresh' link.</li>
				<li class="admin">Tweaked varedit styles ever so slightly: it will now likely use a more preferred monospace font. Keys are bold and also monospace.</li>
				<li class="admin">'NOFALL' is now a status flag instead of being a var specific to BSTechs. It allows the mob to move between Z-levels and through empty space; even to 'fly up' against gravity. However the tech can no longer use this to 'phase into' matter if there is something above them.</li>
				<li class="admin">For that you want to use Ruin-Everything instead: incorporeal movement now has an additional type that's just like a ninja's, but it also allows you to move between Z-levels.</li>
				<li class="admin">Adds the anti-gravity verb to the Bluespace Robot preset and starts them with 'NOFALL' on.</li>

				<li class="admin">BSTechs now have additional vision mode - 'darkvision' for seeing normally but without lighting.</li>
				<li class="admin">Some of the more arcane BSTech verbs have been renamed and descriptions improved (with some added flavour). Rejuv -> Restore Health. Toggle-Gravity -> Toggle-Falling (we now have actual gravity on the station, so let's not confuse people). And finally Ruin-Everything -> Toggle Incorporeal Movement - as lovely as the name is, it doesn't make much sense. This isn't Kill-Everyone or whatever.</li>
				<li class="refactor">Thanks to the above changes the BST is now self-contained in a single file (well except for the robot preset).</li>
				<li class="refactor">To facilitate the above changes several godmode and incorporeal checks have been added (mostly to movement procs). It cuts on some extra proc overrides and type checks. Also results in a more 'natural' experience when using NOFALL, GODMODE or incorporeal movement.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Amunak updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Starting message when joining as an AI has been moved to a separate pop-up window and expanded. It is now also available as a verb 'AI-Help'. This prevents message spam when they start while providing more information to new players. It also contains OOC info noting that players should be mindful of not ruining fun for others.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Airlocks hacking UI now shows pretty colors for the values. Also tweaked some messages and display of the UI. Most importantly, when power is off the message is now simplified to 'all the lights are off'.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Whether AIs can or cannot bolt airlocks is now determined by new states of the 'AI control' wire. It is no longer just 'off' (or cut or emagged) and 'on'. It can be 'off' (cut), 'red' (emagged), 'orange' (AI can control doors but not bolt them) or 'green' (AI can bolt or unbolt the doors). Pulsing the control wire toggles between green and orange, cutting and emagging still works the same. Some airlocks are 'locked' (can be mapped or changed by subtype; currently high security doors do this) and pulsing the control wire does nothing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The 'AI control' state of most airlocks defaults to whether the airlock is locked (mappers and airlock subtypes can override this). This means that most airlocks are by default 'orange', so AIs cannot drop (or raise!) bolts on the vast majority of airlocks. The exception are secure airlocks, hatches (like on tcommsat) and external airlocks whose bolts can be controlled by the AI (in case of external airlocks most are bolted anyway, so AI would have bolt control regardless).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There is now an announcement and a delay of 8 seconds for raising and 4 seconds for dropping the bolts by AIs (traitor AIs are not affected by this, though they can choose to 'fake' it). High security doors have even higher delays (10/5) and vault has the highest (12/8). It is also no longer possible to spam the message - only one action can be done at a time and AIs must wait for it to complete.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked some AI airlock action messages to facilitate the above changes. Additionally the bolt announcement message is now an audible instead of visual.</li>
				<li class="tweak">AIs, when using 'Radio Settings', now see their radio channel keys. They are also displayed in 'AI-Help'.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Door now properly updates icon when it regains power.</li>
				<li class="backend">Moved code that gathers radio channels for AI to a separate proc.</li>
				<li class="admin">Fixes admin check in airlock VueUI. Also allows admins to actually toggle stuff like bolts, safeties and electrification. De-admin yourself if you want to actually play!</li>
				<li class="refactor">Refactored some of the airlock code, especially stuff regarding displaying messages and toggling bolts. Some of it was necessary for these changes, other parts I think I just made more readable.</li>

				<li class="experiment">An entirely new medical system! Holy balls that's a lot of changes.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Pain has been SUBSTANTIALLY changed. It now depends on total damage to all your limbs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Traumas no longer happen due to oxyloss.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Inaprovaline has been renamed to norepinephrine and viceversa.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CPR has been fixed up a bit. It has a small chance to restart hearts and can work with or without mouth-to-mouth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans no longer die when hitting 200 damage. Dionae, IPCs, grues and zombies are exceptions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans now die when their brain dies. For the brain to die, it must not have oxygen for quite a while.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Suffocation damage is now a modifier to blood. If you don't have much oxygen, then you'll get the effects of low blood.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Toxins now directly target organs. They'll try to destroy the liver and kidneys first... then move onto other organs. Be careful.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All organs in the body now work towards making sure the brain lives. The liver filters toxins, the kidneys do the same, the lungs provide oxygen, the heart pumps blood and so on.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans now have two new stats: blood oxygenation and blood pressure, shown on sensors and scanners. Blood pressure depends on how well your heart is pumping your blood. Blood oxygenation depends on how well your blood is oxygenated.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Your heart can now stop when your pulse is too high. Your pulse depends on many factors - like pain or how much blood your brain wants. A heart in asystole cannot pump blood, meaning your brain will suffocate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When your heart stops, you go into asystole, aka flatlining. This can be fixed with CPR. Make sure that you fix the causes first... or they'll just go into asystole again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Norepinephrine stabilizes your heartrate. This is a VERY important fact, do NOT forget this. Norepinephrine will be your best tool!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tricordazine recipe is now 1u epinephrine 1u dylovene.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adrenaline has been added. Its recipe is 1u norepinephrine 1u hyperzine 1u dexalinplus.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bicaridine recipe is now 1u norepinephrine 1u carbon.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Paroxetine recipe is now 1u mindbreaker 1u acetone 1u norepinephrine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nightlife recipe is now 1u methylphenidate 1u synaptizine 1u nitroglycerin.</li>
				<li class="tweak">RMT recipe is now 1u potassium 1u norepinephrine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ondansetron, a chemical that prevents vomiting and nausea, is made with 1u antihistamine 1u synaptizine 1u water.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dexalin and dexalin+ no longer straight up heal oxyloss. Instead, they now fool your brain into thinking that it has 50% oxygen and 80% oxygen respectively.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Alkysine now only heals the brain if it's properly oxygenated.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a stomach organ. This controls reagent ingestion and food ingestion.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a stomach pump mode to sleepers to pump INGESTED reagents out of people's stomach.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Peridaxon now heals brain damage, if it's not damaged much at all.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dylovene no longer outright heals toxin damage. Instead, it removes toxin reagents from the blood.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New side effects to most healing chems. Be careful.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Deltamivir now inflicts a fever. Be careful, going overboard with the dosage can give you a pretty bad one. Try not to go over 20 units at once.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bicaridine now gives you muscle spasms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Kelotane makes you drop your held items. Dermaline does the same, as it is now a subtype.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Throwing beakers now shatters them. Be careful.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Numbers have been deleted from scanners. Mostly. Stop using terms like brute and burn damage, boys.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Taking a good chunk of damage at once now produces adrenaline. Acts like a painkiller and raises your pulse. Might also restart your heart.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Soulstones work only when someone's in asystole.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed how getting organ damage works. Lasers now deal organ damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Most organs can now take more punishment.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The head is now harder to hit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The organ damage dealt now depends on the size of the organ in the area you hit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Surgery pain is MUCH higher if you're awake.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Self surgery works again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using a scalpel on necrotic organs now fixes the necrosis. However, it'll also lower the organ's max damage as well.</li>

				<li class="maptweak">Sublevel has received some quality of life improvements for Engineers, predominantly involving Atmospherics, but also with the Tesla and airlocks.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Atmospherics was made larger, now has a large tank for N2O, and was also given a large tank for custom gas mixes. A gas heater was also added alongside the previous gas cooler, an engineering console with remote Air Alarm Control was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things to actually do.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the station on its own, and then some.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks. They were very prone to becoming stuck due to a lack of air, this should help stop that and make using said airlocks more viable.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don't let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>
