changes:

  - rscadd: "Surge damage makes mechanical or assisted limbs count as broken and nonfunctional."
  - rscadd: "Surge damage has special interactions with the mechanical heart and eyes."
  - tweak: "EMP damage is no longer randomized. It is now much more consistent."
  - tweak: "IPC battery is no longer represented as nutrition. Instead, the microbattery organ contains a super-capacity cell that is used for all their actions. This is represented with a new HUD icon."
  - tweak: "Hardsuits can now be charged in robot chargers if you are wearing them."
  - rscadd: "Ion bolts now have a hit sound."
  - rscdel: "Removed the ion rifle lethal mode."
  - tweak: "The ion rifle now has four shots."
  - tweak: "EMP'd guns no longer get discharged. Instead, they lock up for an amount of time depending on the strength of the EMP."
