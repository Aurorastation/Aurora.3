changes:
  - tweak: "Vampire's Hypnotise ability now renders the victim unable to speak while stunned, much like the changeling's silence sting."
  - tweak: "Vampire scaling boosted, we should now see the game spawn more than one vampire."
  - tweak: "Vampires now lose frenzy faster while feeding. One victim, completely drained, should be enough to get out of a mid-level frenzy."
  - bugfix: "Vampire thralls are no longer given vampiric abilities/powers."
