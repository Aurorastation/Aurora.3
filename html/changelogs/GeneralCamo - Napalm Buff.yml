delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Changed how napalm works. Instead of directly causing turf fires, napalm now creates a long-term burning turf fire."
  - rscadd: "Split Zo'rane fire and napalm. Zo'rane fire is now a much more powerful version of napalm."
  - rscadd: "Added a military-grade flamethrower, capable of using napalm. Other fuels instead give a 150% power bonus."
  - balance: "Standard (improvised) flamethrowers are no longer capable of using napalm. They will explode if you try."
  - rscadd: "Using a wrench on a flamethrower will now prompt you to dismantle either the igniter, welding tool, or whole thing."
  - rscadd: "Flamethrowers can now be upgraded in the field."
  - balance: "Reduced the cost of the standard flamethrower in the uplink from 10 to 6."
