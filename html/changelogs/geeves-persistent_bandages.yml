changes:
  - rscadd: "Bandages now do not disappear as damage heals, instead, a special Remove Bandages verb must be used to remove bandages. This cannot be used to re-open wounds for now, and can only be used if the bandage would've downgraded / disappeared at that point."
  - balance: "Taking damage on a bandaged limb now removes the bandages."
