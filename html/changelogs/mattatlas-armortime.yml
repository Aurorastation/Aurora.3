# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

changes:
  - experiment: "Ported a new armor system from Baystation. It's far more modular and allows for more granularity. Armor is now exponential and will block damage better the lower it is from the armor rating."
  - balance: "Notably, armor now removes damage flags if the damage is blocked significantly. This means no more bleeding from a 2 damage projectile."
  - balance: "Due to this, a lot of guns were buffed, including Security and antagonist guns alike. Some things may be a bit too strong or a bit too weak."
  - balance: "Likewise, a lot of armor has received buffs. Mech armor should now be considerably more durable."
  - balance: "Re-added laser organ damage."
  - tweak: "Increased the cost of the sharpened bear trap."
