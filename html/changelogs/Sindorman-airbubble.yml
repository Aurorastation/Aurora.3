changes:
  - rscadd: "Aribbubbles now have a intergrated cooling unit. It require a power cell to be attached either externally or internally by clicking on the bubble with power cell. The bubble cools down as fast as suit cooling unit and consumes 2 times less charge than a suit cooling unit."
  - tweak: "Airbubbles now show the attached cell type and its charge when examined."
