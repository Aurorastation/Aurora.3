changes:
  - tweak: "If venting happened, third parties wouldn't be able to use their emergency shutters to escape since it inherently has horizon engineering access required, which is ideally supposed to make it so non-engineers can't open the way into vented areas. Was rectified by adding a variant that needs no access to open. Every window and door has the proper type of emergency shutter now."
  - rscadd: "Defined more areas for the kataphract ship since a lot of what was mapped in was pulling double duty for extra rooms. This would lead to some buggy and confusing interactions, especially for those far apart."
  - tweak: "Lights in the kataship hangar were swapped for spotlights, as intended. Still looks the same, it just shines brighter."
  - tweak: "Some of the air alarms still had engineering access requirements, which was hopefully fixed on a second pass and changed to kata id stuff instead."
  - rscdel: "Removed the unused kata trader and quartermaster access types."
  - tweak: "The kata ship docking airlock will actually start bolted now."
  - tweak: "the kata ship airlock pumps will both cycle now instead of just one working."
  - rscdel: "There were catwalks visible on the solars of the kataship when you look at the map using dream maker or strongdmm. These didn't spawn in the game itself as they weren't the interior type. Removed those from the map file."
  - tweak: "Moved the position of the kata shuttle's docking port controller, since it was positioned in a way that it would overlay over anything put on the table it was originally on."
  - rscadd: "Added the missing air alarms and other minor atmos equipment where it was missing on the kataphract ship, like the janitorial room or the brig."
  - tweak: "Fixes blastdoor orientations on the kata ship bridge and transport shuttle."
