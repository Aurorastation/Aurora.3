changes: 
  - rscdel: "Brain damage no longer causes effects directly. It will now introduce trauma traits based on a threshold-percentage progression. Brain damage still causes brain-death at 60."
  - rscadd: "Adds trauma traits: Come in three flavors: mild, severe, and special. Mild range from annoying to dangerous. Severe range from dangerous to annoyingly dangerous. Special are oddly beneficial, sometimes"
  - rscadd: "Normally a mob can only have one mild trauma and one severe/special trauma at a time."
  - rscadd: "Citalopram and Paroxetine can be used to suppress traumas, while brain surgery can be used to remove them. Maybe the psychiatrist will see some use? Not."
  - rscadd: "Oxygen loss will now cause brain damage if it is severe enough."
  - rscadd: "Intoxication will now induce brain damage at a severe enough level."
  - balance: "Many brain damaging effects have been given a cap, making them non-lethal."
