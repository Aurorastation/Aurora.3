changes:
  - balance: "Split telecrystals into telecrystals and bluecrystals. Bluecrystals are used to buy gimmick or support items, whereas telecrystals are used for ammunition and offensive items. When making a purchase that allows both BC and TC, bluecrystals are prioritised."
  - bugfix: "Fixed liquidbags in the uplink not spawning as a stack of 25."
