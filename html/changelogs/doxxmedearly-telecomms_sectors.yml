changes:
  - rscadd: "Radio communications are now limited by sector distance. The default max range is two grids. The centcomm level, ERT staging, and antagonist bases are exempt from this."
  - tweak: "Ships will now only hear other ships' communications if they are within this range. Get close on the overmap if you want to eavesdrop. Note that away ships will still only hear the Ship Frequency, not Horizon comms."
  - bugfix: "Away ship roles should no longer get duplicated radio messages, even when in comms range of multiple other away ships."
  - tweak: "As away shuttles do not have telecomms units, they will no longer receive radio broadcasts when departed, if they were previously able to. Intrepid/Mining shuttle can still speak DURING the bluespace jump, away ships cannot. Holopads are unaffected."
  - maptweak: "Added an External Signal Receiver to the Horizon tcomms room. This does not need any special setup or connections, and while powered, will allow away ships to communicate with their crew who are aboard the Horizon. This has no bearing on antagonists, so disabling it won't help you there, crafty engineers."
