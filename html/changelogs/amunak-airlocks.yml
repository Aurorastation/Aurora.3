changes:
  - rscadd: "Starting message when joining as an AI has been moved to a separate pop-up window and expanded. It is now also available as a verb 'AI-Help'. This prevents message spam when they start while providing more information to new players. It also contains OOC info noting that players should be mindful of not ruining fun for others."
  - rscadd: "Airlocks hacking UI now shows pretty colors for the values. Also tweaked some messages and display of the UI. Most importantly, when power is off the message is now simplified to 'all the lights are off'."
  - rscadd: "Whether AIs can or cannot bolt airlocks is now determined by new states of the 'AI control' wire. It is no longer just 'off' (or cut or emagged) and 'on'. It can be 'off' (cut), 'red' (emagged), 'orange' (AI can control doors but not bolt them) or 'green' (AI can bolt or unbolt the doors). Pulsing the control wire toggles between green and orange, cutting and emagging still works the same. Some airlocks are 'locked' (can be mapped or changed by subtype; currently high security doors do this) and pulsing the control wire does nothing."
  - rscadd: "The 'AI control' state of most airlocks defaults to whether the airlock is locked (mappers and airlock subtypes can override this). This means that most airlocks are by default 'orange', so AIs cannot drop (or raise!) bolts on the vast majority of airlocks. The exception are secure airlocks, hatches (like on tcommsat) and external airlocks whose bolts can be controlled by the AI (in case of external airlocks most are bolted anyway, so AI would have bolt control regardless)."
  - rscadd: "There is now an announcement and a delay of 8 seconds for raising and 4 seconds for dropping the bolts by AIs (traitor AIs are not affected by this, though they can choose to 'fake' it). High security doors have even higher delays (10/5) and vault has the highest (12/8). It is also no longer possible to spam the message - only one action can be done at a time and AIs must wait for it to complete."
  - tweak: "Tweaked some AI airlock action messages to facilitate the above changes. Additionally the bolt announcement message is now an audible instead of visual."
  - tweak: "AIs, when using 'Radio Settings', now see their radio channel keys. They are also displayed in 'AI-Help'."
  - bugfix: "Door now properly updates icon when it regains power."
  - backend: "Moved code that gathers radio channels for AI to a separate proc."
  - admin: "Fixes admin check in airlock VueUI. Also allows admins to actually toggle stuff like bolts, safeties and electrification. De-admin yourself if you want to actually play!"
  - refactor: "Refactored some of the airlock code, especially stuff regarding displaying messages and toggling bolts. Some of it was necessary for these changes, other parts I think I just made more readable."
