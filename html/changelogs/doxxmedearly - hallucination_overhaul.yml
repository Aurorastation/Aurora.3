changes: 
  - rscadd: "Hallucination handling has been totally overhauled by taking, modifying and tremendously expanding on Bay's system. Goodbye, 2012 hallucination code."
  - rscdel: "Removed the following hallucination effects: Fake HUD updates, items spawning in your hand, 'fake death', and pun-pun attacking you."
  - rscadd: "Added over a dozen new categories of potential hallucination effects. Some are subtle, some are more overt. Increased the variety of previously-existing hallucination effects."
  - rscadd: "Added several large lists of prompts that should keep hallucinations varied and interesting for a long time. These can also easily be expanded upon!"
  - tweak: "Sounds will have less reverb while hallucinating, so you probably won't need to tear your headset off while resisting a cult conversion."
  - backend: "Created a subsystem for hallucinations. Larger prompt lists were added as text files."
