changes:
  - balance: "All flash effects (flashbang, flashes, welding w.o protection, etc.) now deal damage to eyes relative to their effect intensity."
  - balance: "Handheld flashes are now significantly more powerful, no longer stopped by sunglasses, etc."
  - balance: "Handheld flashes' AOE flash can now be performed by using them in-hand with harm intent."
  - refactor: "Backend code for flash effects now unified under flash_act. Stunning sonic effects (e.g. flashbangs) now unified under soundbang_act."
  - refactor: "Significantly cleaned up handheld flash code."
  - tweak: "Vaurcae and Tajarans will now only take extra damage from flashes when their night vision is active, and when they do not have flash protection."
  - tweak: "Dionae now take flash damage from all sorts of flashes, and are weakened by major sources (welding, flashes). They also gain energy equal to the intensity of the flash."
