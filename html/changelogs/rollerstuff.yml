changes:
  - tweak: "Changed the roller bed sprites. They are now a bit bulkier (for ease of clicking) and a bit brighter."
  - tweak: "Roller bed IVs now show up on the left of the bed, not the right, so they are no longer blocked by medhuds. The fluid low light is now a tad more obvious too."
  - tweak: "You can now buckle body bags and cryo bags to roller beds."
  - tweak: "Roller beds are now normal sized items, so they fit in your bag."
  - tweak: "Trying to pull someone buckled_to to something now attempts to pull that thing instead."
