changes:
  - tweak: "Announcements now only show up to the affected Z-levels."
  - rscadd: "Barricades have been ported from CM-SS13! You can build steel, wood and plasteel barricades through the respective material build menus. Plasteel barricades can be flipped to allow entry. Additionally, you can link one or more plasteel barricades together with a crowbar to make them flip open at the same time."
  - rscadd: "Added barbed wire as a stack item, made from steel. You can use it to wire barricades, preventing climbing. Barbed barricades also deal damage to simple mobs or human mobs that try to slice barricades open with their hands, such as zombies."
  - rscadd: "Added liquidbag barricades. They're bags filled with non-Newtonian liquid! You can find them in the crew armoury and the normal armoury, along with barbed wire to set on them. These can be set down by everyone. Use crowbars to disassemble these."
  - rscadd: "Added liquidbags and steel to merc and raider shuttles respectively."
  - rscadd: "Added a 25 liquidbag option to the Devices and Tools section of the uplink for 3 TC."
  - rscadd: "Note that the PEAC works *extremely well* on barricades! If you want a barricade buster, use the PEAC!"
  - rscdel: "Removed the Call ERT option from the keycard authenticators."
  - rscadd: "Calling a distress beacon now prompts the first person to swipe for a message. This message will then pop up as a distress beacon to all other Overmap ships."
  - rscadd: "Added a distress beacon button to the cockpit of every offmap ship. It only requires one person to press it, but otherwise works just like the keycard authentication option."
  - maptweak: "The PEAC has been moved to the standard Security armoury."
  - rscadd: "Bullets now ping off of walls, structures and machinery! Try it out. It's a cool effect. Ported from CM-SS13."
  - rscadd: "Added the Jingya A-1, a Nanotrasen burst rifle with a single shot mode and two-shot burst mode. It fires 5.56 rounds in carbine magazines. It is also available in the uplinks for 8 telecrystals. Sprites by Kyres1!"
  - rscadd: "Added the Noctiluca XM28, a Zavodskoi combat laser rifle that can switch between a normal firing mode (slightly less damage than the laser rifle, better armor piercing) and an armor piercing mode (much less damage, but extremely high armor piercing). It is available in the uplink for 8 telecrystals. Sprites by Kyres1!"
  - rscadd: "The crew armory has received a massive buff and now contains two Noctilucas, four ballistic carbines and three .45 pistols. It also contains more useful items in general."
  - rscadd: "The crew armory's weapon lockers now require either Bridge access or Armory access to open, instead of requiring only armory access."
