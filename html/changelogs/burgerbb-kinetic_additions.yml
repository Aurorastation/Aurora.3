changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds several new and unique kinetic accelerator parts that can only be found in warehouse or in abandoned crates."
  - tweak: "Kinetic Accelerators can now be held with two hands for a recoil reduction, accuracy increase, and slight firerate increase. Some high-end kinetic accelerators require two hands to fire, and all kinetic accelerators require two hands to pump."
  - rscadd: "Adds a kinetic analyzer, a device that can be purchased from cargo that analyzes kinetic accelerators, displaying useful data about the assembly."
