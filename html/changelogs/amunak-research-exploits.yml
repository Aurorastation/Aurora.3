changes:
  - rscdel: "It is no longer possible to recycle any random crap in the Autolathe. It is now limited to 'reasonable' items such as materials, tiles, reagent containers, power cells, shields and a handful of other things. Complex devices, guns, stuff that clearly wouldn't fit or doesn't make much sense to recycle (returns almost no useful materials) is no longer possible to recycle."
  - bugfix: "It should be no longer possible to 'cheat' in the Autolathe by inserting items that give more materials than they cost to make in the Protolathe."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a handful of the remaining problematic autolathe recipes / recyclation materials to not cost less than they're worth."
  - bugfix: "Fixes minor instatiation issues with hand teleporter and an organ when initialized in a non-typical way."
  - refactor: "Moved the list of research designs to global level. This allows only single initialization of it."
  - backend: "When research designs initialize they check if the material costs are greater than what can be gained from them by recycling."
