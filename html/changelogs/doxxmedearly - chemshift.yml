changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added Pneumalin, a medication that is targeted to fix lung damage, which should decrease reliance on peridaxon. Make it by using a 1:1:1 ratio of cough syrup, copper, and pulmodeiectionem. Overdoses above 15u, causing a dangerous drop in a person's pulse."
  - rscdel: "Removed inaprovaline. Replaced all bottles and syringes with norepinephrine. Itching and cramps are now relieved by norepinephrine."
  - tweak: "Dylovene is now less effective at treating hallucinations. Use synaptizine."
  - tweak: "Adipemcina no longer relies on or affects a person's nutrition level to function. It also metabolizes a little faster."
  - tweak: "Removed adrenaline effects from norepinephrine."
  - tweak: "Kelotane will no longer heal burns if dermaline is present in a person's system. It will metabolize with no effect until the dermaline is gone."
  - bugfix: "Dermaline now recovers the proper amount of burn damage, instead of being equivalent to kelotane."
  - bugfix: "Deltamivir will no longer cause organ-boiling fevers at 20u dosage. It will still cause a slight fever, so keep that in mind!"
