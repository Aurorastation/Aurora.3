changes:
  - tweak: "Practically all footwear that taj could wear have been adjusted to better fit them. Same for voidsuits, hardsuit boot segments. This is hopefully the last time I ever have to adjust something like this. Minor issues like exposed body parts were fixed along the way for some items."
  - tweak: "Taj have their own blood overlays and damage overlays now to make it easier to reflect certain things on the unique parts of their sprite now."
