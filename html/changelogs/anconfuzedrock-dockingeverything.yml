changes:
  - tweak: "The Horizon's docking port that's used by the orion express ship now shares a frequency with it, allowing it to actually dock."
  - bugfix: "The Spark dock airlock functions as an actual airlock again"
  - tweak: "The Intrepid's transit zone has been moved- due to complications it will not autodock, but it can pseudo-dock with south facing docking ports easily now."
  - tweak: "The Spark's transit marks have been moved, so they can now dock properly with any functional south-facing dock."
