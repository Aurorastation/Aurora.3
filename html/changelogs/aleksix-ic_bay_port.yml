# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - wip: "Ported a lot of different components from Baystation, such as pullers, maintenance clamps, filters, reagent cooler/heater etc."
  - wip: "Added IC duplication. Schemas can be saved by the user to be loaded and printed at a later time. Schemas can be seen by the assembly creator or by using an assembly analyser. Duplication takes resources and time, but the latter can be removed with an upgrade."
  - rscadd: "Weapon firing mechanism can now change firing modes on the weapon."
  - tweak: "Weapon firing mechanism nerfed - fire delay is now equal to (gun's firing rate * 5), with a minimum of 30 ms (Bay's idea, not mine). However, it doesn't require a firing pin."
  - balance: "Assemblies now have specializations - only the gun assembly can fire weapons and throw items, to ensure that weapons are easier to recognize (Again, bay's idea)."
  - tweak: "IC Medical analyser nerfed and changed to adhere to the handheld analyser - the basic IC med. analyser only reports basic vitals - brain activity, pulse and conciousness. IC advanced med. analyser reports an estimation of damage in terms of levels (0-4, where 0 is no damage, 4 is ~ 80 damage)."
  - tweak: "Integrated circuits now work with their own specialized tools instead of the multitool."
  - rscadd: "IC printer, assemblies and components now have reactive VueUI interfaces."
  - rscadd: "Circuit bag now contains list and filter bags."
  - rscadd: "Added the fast cloning disk to the protolathe."
  - bugfix: "Assemblies no longer spawn with free device cells."
