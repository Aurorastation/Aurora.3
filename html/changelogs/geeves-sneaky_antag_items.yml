changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added sharpened bear traps, a mechanical trap that ignores armour in the clamp action, to the Stealthy and Inconspicuous Weapons uplink."
  - bugfix: "Bear traps will no longer trap you if they take your limb off while triggering."
  - rscadd: "Added closet teleporters to the Stealth and Camouflage Items uplink, a device that start linked and can be attached to closets to set-up a teleport network. Step inside and close the door to teleport."
  - tweak: "Pushing a wall to try and find a secret entrance now takes a few seconds of touching and feeling."
