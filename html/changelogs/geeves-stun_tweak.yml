changes:
  - tweak: "CULT: Adjusted stun/incapacitation runes to be blockable by flssh-resistant eyewear. Talismans are blocked by sunglasses, while larger runes are only blocked by welding goggles or voidsuits."
  - tweak: "CULT: Stun/Incapitation runes now flash borgs as well, and the stuns last for longer for the non-talisman variant."
