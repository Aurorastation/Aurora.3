changes: 
  - tweak: "Rig modules now have categories. Each rig now has a list of allowed categories, so for example medical rig cannot have engineering or combat modules installed unless they were pre-installed. Antag rigs have no restrictions, same goes for HAPT."
  - tweak: "ERT suits are now more specialized. Command suit is the only suit that can have any category installed. ERT security RIGs can only have general, combat, special modules. ERT engineering RIGs can only have general, combat, engineering, mining. ERT medical rigs can only have general, combat, medical modules. ERT janitor can obly have general, combat, jantor modules."
