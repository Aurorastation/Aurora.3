changes: 
  - tweak: "Mining now spawns with drills, and budget magboots. Budget magboots can only be worn by humans. Added auto-injectors, mobile ladders, and hoist kits to the mining vendor."
  - rscadd: "Added Petran, a usually hostile beetle-like scavenger species to the asteroid. Petran hide inside rocks, and have a 1% chance per rock destroyed to spawn."
  - maptweak: "Tweaked the Cargo and Mining layout. Fixed some parts of medical not having a tagger destination. Tweaked the layout of xenoarcheology. Added some missing camera coverage."
  - tweak: "Increased the amount of cargo loot spawns from 80 to 100."
  - rscadd: "Added the Pocket Protector, a very weak laser pistol that xenoarchelogists can aquire in the EVA lockers in the sublevel airlock. Only works in EVA with it's current firing pin. Deals reduced damage outside EVA, and even less damage against armoured targets. Takes special cell batteries for power."
  - rscadd: "Added the XenoBlaster, a pump-action magnetic railgun prototype that spawns in abandoned crates. Only works in EVA with it's current firing pin."
