changes: 
  - rscadd: "Mining now spawns with drills, and budget magboots. Budget magboots can only be worn by humans. Added autoinjectors, mobile ladders, and hoist kits to the mining vendor."
  - rscadd: "Added Petran, a usually hostile beetle-like scavanger species to the asteroid. Petran hide inside rocks, and have a 1% chance per rock destroyed to spawn. Dead Petran sometimes attract carp."
  - maptweak: "Tweaked the Cargo and Mining layout. Fixed some parts of medical not having a tagger destination."
  - tweak: "Removed toys and other junk from spawning in the cargo warehouse. Increase the amount of cargo loot spawns from 80 to 100."
