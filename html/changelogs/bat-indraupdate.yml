# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - balance: "Fusion reaction modifications. Higher radiation and temperature output, comparable power output."
  - balance: "Increased rad resistance modifier of Borosilicate Windows from 1 -> 4 and (closed) Blast Doors from 1 -> 6."
  - balance: "INDRA Field Strength minima/maxima changed from 1-100 -> 20-120. Power costs increased significantly."
  - balance: "INDRA instability increase per tick now limited, similar to Supermatter (prevents sudden instability spike from instantly nuking it)."
  - balance: "APC cell charge rate increased 10x."
  - balance: "Rebalanced contents of INDRA hard storage compartment."
  - balance: "SMES coils capacities halved, throughputs doubled."
  - balance: "SMES unit maximum coil capacity increased from 6 -> 8."
  - balance: "TEG maximum power output increased from 500000 -> 2500000."
  - balance: "Power wasted from exceeding TEG maximum power output decreased from 50% to 33%."
  - balance: "Portable generators of all types have had their power generation capacity doubled."
  - rscadd: "New 'Fusion Codex' app added for all crew with ACCESS_ENGINE that details all available nuclear fusion chains."
  - rscadd: "Boron added as a singleton/reagent. Poisonous to vaurca, still usable in nuclear fusion as fuel assembly rods."
  - rscadd: "INDRA Field Strength now scales plasma temperature entropy, power output from temperature multiplier, and instability increase per tick."
  - refactor: "'Boron' gas renamed to 'Helium-3'. Boron is not a gas. Deal with it."
  - refactor: "'Steam' gas renamed to 'Water Vapor'."
  - code_imp: "Descriptions added to gas singletons for future use."
  - qol: "Minor remap of INDRA control room for usability."
  - qol: "Standardized gas canister naming conventions."
  - qol: "INDRA and APC TGUI interfaces now use use kW, MW abbreviations for high wattages."
  - bugfix: "INDRA Kinetic Harvester no longer rapidly deselects materials for harvest when too many are being generated at once."
  - bugfix: "INDRA EM Field effect no longer considers the camera within its reactor chamber a destabilizing influence."
  - bugfix: "INDRA reactor core now produces radiation as intended."
  - bugfix: "Deuterium and Tritium canisters no longer contain 50% standard hydrogen (inheritance issue)."
