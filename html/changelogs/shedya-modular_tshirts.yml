changes: 
  - rscadd: "Various clothing additions, including bowties, cardigans and layerable t-shirts."
  - rscadd: "Evening gloves, waistcoats, swept skirts, short skirts (renamed to pencil skirts) and labcoats are now recolorable in the loadout."
  - tweak: "Winter boots have been reworked and added to the loadout, designed to match the winter coats. They also now have a super secret and probably useless advantage over other boot choices."
