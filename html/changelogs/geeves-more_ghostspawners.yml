  - rscadd: "Syndicate Cyborgs have been added to the ghost spawner menu, and will remain in a boot-up state until someone spawns into it."
  - bugfix: "Syndicate Cyborg eye overlays have been fixed."
  - rscadd: "Wizard Familiars have been added to the ghost spawner menu, same as above."
  - rscadd: "Mining Drones have been added to the ghost spawner menu, one swipe is all you need, until someone joins in as them."
