# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

changes:
  - bugfix: "Suffocating will no longer continuously apply losebreath. This is capped now, thus making recovery periods for suffocation much shorter."
  - bugfix: "The necrotic (dead) organ surgery has been fixed. For internal organs, use a scalpel! Cancel out of the organ removal prompt and the surgery will begin."
  - bugfix: "Wheelchairs no longer interact with the paranormal entities."
  - tweak: "CPR now removes losebreath, thus making it a convenient option if people aren't breathing."
  - tweak: "It is now obvious if the organ is dead following an organ repair surgery."
  - balance: "Getting headshots no longer multiplies damage exponentially if the damage is extremely high."
  - balance: "Headshots no longer make you lose breath."
  - balance: "Organs now need necrotic surgery if they've been dead for over five minutes."
  - balance: "The necrotic organ surgery is now longer, at about ten seconds. It also heals ten damage so that organs don't instantly die anymore."
  - balance: "Slowed brain decay while in cardiac arrest."
  - tweak: "Non-glass (beakers, bottles) or non-bloodbag reagent containers may no longer be put onto roller beds."
  - tweak: "Coffee no longer applies CE_PULSE, which means you won't get spammed by heartbeat for having the audacity to drink it."
