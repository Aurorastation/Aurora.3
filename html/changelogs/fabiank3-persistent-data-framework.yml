changes:
  - rscadd: "Added subsystem for persistent data between rounds. The framework includes the subsystem responsible for managing persistent data and provides functionality for objects to be added to said system. See PR and GitHub Wiki documentation for more technical details."
  - config: "Added new log type for the persistence subsystem."
  - experiment: "Added papers and noticeboards to the persistence subsystem. Papers and their contents (title and text) will now be persistent across rounds when they get pinned to noticeboards. They will loose persistence when they either get unpinned during a round or after no changes within 30 days. Unpinning and re-pinning will keep them persistent; Unpinning, editing and re-pinning will them reset the 30 days expiration time."
