changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added bluespace inhibitors, unique powered destructible machines that scramble bluespace outgoing and incoming signals in an 8 radius range. They can only be found in the vault, the armory, and the AI core. This affects features that involve bluespace, including wizard (not jaunt!) and ninja teleport."
  - balance: "Wizards can no longer randomly teleport on openspace tiles."
