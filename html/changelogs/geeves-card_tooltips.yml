changes: 
  - rscadd: "You can now draw from card decks and hands by clicking on them with an empty hand while it's in one of your hands."
  - rscadd: "Mousing over a card that's next to you, or face-side-up, will show a tooltip of what it is."
  - tweak: "Drawing a card from a deck now draws a specific card. Dealing a card to someone will pick the first card of the deck, meaning that it has to be shuffled to be random."
