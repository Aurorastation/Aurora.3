changes: 
  - bugfix: "KAs now account for atmosphere the shot is fired at. Reducing damage if inside of atmosphere. Maximum damage for KAs to living being is capped at 50 per shot."
  - tweak: "KAs AOE now damages anything in its range. It looses 25% of damage totally per tile. So first tile is 100%, second is 75% less, third looses 25% off second and so on. It still damagaes rock with 100% damage of original."
  - tweak: "Mechs KAs damage was increased, and AOE of 5(That is a lot!) tiles was added. Keep in mind that AOE will damage mech itself if in range. Regular mech KA damage is now 40 per shot. Burst KA damage is now 25 per shot(that is 75 in total)."
