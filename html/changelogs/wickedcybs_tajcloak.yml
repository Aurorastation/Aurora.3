changes:
  - rscadd: "Added attachable versions of some of the new taj cloaks. They can't raise their hoods or have an internal storage as a consequence."
  - tweak: "The new fancy cloak that was added was renamed to 'black fancy cloak' in the loadout, as it was sharing a name with an existing cloak already."
  - tweak: "The aysmmetrical cloak was remamed to 'royalist cloak' as it had a New Kingdom symbol on its back."
