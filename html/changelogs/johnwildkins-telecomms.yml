changes:
  - rscdel: "Tcomms relays have been removed. All telecomms machines now handle traffic on all connected z-levels by default, making them superfluous."
  - refactor: "Ported and overhauled generated away site frequencies from Bay. Away ships and sites now have their own radio frequency, accessible via ';' or ':h'."
  - rscadd: "Hailing frequency, ':y', added to all ships and most of the command / exploration crew on the Horizon. Radios (headsets) now have a button to reset to their preset frequency, if tuned away."
  - backend: "Significantly overhauled the systems underpinning telecomms / radio broadcasts, relying more directly on /datum/signal creation."
  - backend: "Ported the spatial grid / orthogonal range search algorithms from /tg/, making checks for hearers in range much faster, and thus easing server load during high-pop events."
  - backend: "Ported the trait system from /tg/ and refactored / reorganized telecomms machines as necessary for the above changes."
