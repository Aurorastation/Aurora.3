changes:
  - backend: "/reagent/toxin/phoron no longer spawns in-game, replaced with three new types."
  - rscadd: "Phoron can be phoron/base, which is the one the SCC is looking for, phoron/kois, which spawns in unfiltered k'ois bars and k'ois fungus and is only useful for Vaurca, and phoron/kois/black, which is useful for bioterrorism."
  - bugfix: "This means that you can no longer solve the phoron crisis with k'ois. For now?"
