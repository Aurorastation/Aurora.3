changes:
  - tweak: "Modified the way the cell charge anomaly works. It no longer uses absurd ranges to charge stuff."
  - tweak: "ZAS might be a tick slower at kicking objects around for large zones. On the flip side, it shouldn't lag the server as consistently anymore."
  - tweak: "VV might take a bit to generate the VV screen for large entries."
