changes: 
  - bugfix: "Meat and cutlets should now be able to be properly sliced by edged items, such as regular kitchen knives, hatchets, and cleavers."
  - bugfix: "When slicing meat and cutlets, their reagents should now properly transfer to the new products."
  - tweak: "Slipping items into food has changed slightly to prevent weird interactions. You will now only slip items into food on harm intent. Now you can actually slice things with the cleaver instead of shoving it into that dough or cheese wheel."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer slice throats with spoons or forks."
