changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added crayon dust to crayons! You can now place crayons in grinders to get dust. Using or eating a crayon will reduce the amount of dust it gives."
  - rscadd: "Added unique flavor descriptions to each color of crayon dust. Sol Marines rejoice!"
  - rscadd: "The biogenerator is now able to produce boxes of crayons."
  - tweak: "Regular crayons now effectively have 20 uses, down from 30. Mime and Rainbow crayons are no longer infinite, but last longer than normal crayons (and give more crayon dust!)"
