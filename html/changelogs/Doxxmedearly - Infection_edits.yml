changes:
  - bugfix: "People with infections should experience fevers once again. The intensity of all active infections dictates how strong the fever is."
  - bugfix: "Fixed perconol's anti-fever strength being in the millions at certain doses. It now has a flat rate."
  - tweak: "Each infection will now only spread to one internal organ and one limb at a time, instead of spreading to all limbs it can touch."
  - tweak: "Having 5u of thetamycin in the bloodstream will now prevent infections from spreading. It will still need to metabolize to the proper dose before it begins to cure them."
  - rscadd: "Grab examine will now indicate if you see in infection on that limb, and how bad it is. Look for messages that say the skin is warm and reddened."
  - rscadd: "Leporazine now also acts as a fever reducer."
