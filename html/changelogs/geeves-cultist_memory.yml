  - backend: "Converted how Vampire and Changeling variables are handled on the backend, let me know if there's something funky."
  - rscadd: "Cultists can now memorize up to three runes, and can scribe them at will without a tome, at the cost of taking three times longer to do so. Check the Cultists tab in the top right. Only specific runes can be memorized."
