changes:
  - rscadd: "Added fuel pipes. Fuel pipes are intended to carry fuel for vessels, and have their own dedicated pump and connector for this."
  - rscadd: "Added auxiliary pipes. Auxiliary pipes are intended primarily for airlocks, but can be used in other various means. They have their own dedicated pump, connector, and vent."
  - rscadd: "Added a mode to airlock controllers to cycle air externally. This prevents external, potentially poisonous air from mixing with clean air."
  - tweak: "Thrusters can now attach directly to fuel pipes."
  - maptweak: "The Intrepid and Spark now have externally cycled airlocks, and utilize the new pipes."
  - maptweak: "Added a scrubber to the Spark, which is directly vented out into space."
  - imageadd: "Ported Keekenox#1337's vents and scrubbers."
