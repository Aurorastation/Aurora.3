changes:
  - experiment: "Psionics have been reworked to use the Technomancer ability system. This means that you get physical ability objects in your hand to use (in hand, melee, or ranged)."
  - rscadd: "You can shift click psionic abilities at the top to obtain info about them."
  - rscadd: "Suppressing your psionics is no longer a thing. Your psionics are only suppressed if you are stunned through overusing them, and they will automatically unsuppress once you recover. Psionic suppression has been introduced instead: using it will hide you from Psi-Search."
  - rscadd: "Added a psionic point shop, opened by clicking your psionic hub icon. This is also usable by non-antags, but they can't buy anything: it's still useful to use it to know what your powers do and how to use them!"
  - rscadd: "Antagonists get points usable in the psionic point shop. This varies per antag: Loners get 8, borer hosts get 3 (increased by borers with Advance Psionics)."
  - tweak: "Reworked the Psi ranks. The canon ones are Psionically Sensitive (Skrell), Psionically Harmonious (exceptional Skrell born with better psionic control), Psionic Apex (unknown to everyone, really). There's also an admin-only non-canon Limitless level."
  - rscadd: "Every 30 minutes, psionics will be pinged in their chat about their emotional state, which can be one from a selection. A few minutes after, the responses will be tallied together and the winning emotion will be broadcasted. Higher psionic rank means higher vote value."
  - rscadd: "Added a psionic jumpstarter to the antagonist uplink for 19 telecrystals. It will boost you to Psionically Harmonious, but with only 8 psi points."
  - rscadd: "Added a truckload of new psionic abilities. No, really. They're a lot."
  - rscadd: "Skrell may choose additional psionics to spawn with in their loadout."
  - rscadd: "Added mechanical support for the lack of a Zona Bovinae, mainly for vaurcae and dionae. In certain cases, a Zona Bovinae may even be removed from someone..."
  - rscdel: "Psionically deaf species like Vaurcae or IPCs or Dionae can no longer take psi-receivers."
