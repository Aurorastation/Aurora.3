changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new third party, the Kataphract Chapter Ship. Representing the Hegemony's finest abroad, probably. They're out for adventure and to prove themselves. Trade for supplies for the long road ahead, quest, act with honour."
  - rscadd: "The emergency services dock isn't just limited to the ERT TCFL shuttle anymore. The OX ship, TCFL third party shuttle and Kataphract shuttle should be able to dock to it too now. It's also been futureproofed and can be used by most ships with a south facing airlock."
  - rscadd: "Added two SMES subtypes for mappers. One is turned on and has a capacitance coil for autostarted solars, the other is a little less beefy SMES for shuttles. Should be nice for mappers."
  - tweak: "Had to make fuel ports by default spawn with nothing inside. A subtype with phoron already inside the hatch was made and should be replacing all the fuel ports as of now. This had to be done, as the way it was initalized, hydrogen ports would have 2 fuel tanks inside, one phoron one hydrogen."
  - tweak: "Moved the hangar landmarks for the OX and TCFL ship as well as the docking landmark on the Horizon for south facing ports. It's placed below the airlocks in all cases to better accomodate ship design, as having it to the side was causing issues."
