changes:
  - qol: "Updated airlock behavior on power loss. Airlocks will no longer open when they lose power but instead will stay closed or will close if already open."
  - rscadd: "Added airlock manual override mechanic. When an airlock is functional and unbolted but simply has no power, a manual override can be used to open it. Click the unpowered airlock with an empty hand to start the override procedure. This process takes around thirty seconds and will force open the airlock without requiring any tool. It's designed for emergency cases when power failed. The door will close again after regaining power after the emergency override has been used."
