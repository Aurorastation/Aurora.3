changes: 
  - rscadd: "Generally: changed bar and kitchen into a semi-united bistro; moved hydroponics to where southern bar was, using up the empty maintenance space there."
  - rscadd: "Hallway west of Medbay Cryo Storage now has a table facing the bar instead of the hydroponics entrance."
  - rscadd: "Drinking bar is now circular, with three sides; has an anchored booze cabinet for holding stuff dispensed from the booze-o-mat; the teapot has been pre-filled with tea; two shakers and rags are in the open, instead of one; the bar's backroom is a straight line; gloves and colored lights, chemical dispenser cartridges, and a screwdriver (for handling cartridges) were added to the backroom; the bar's delivery disposals is now in the backroom; the bar has an island in front of the drink machines; there is a drinks showcase next to the drinks showcase machine, just like the kitchen has; the barsign should now be changeable (it was out of reach); there are 14 total seats around the bar area now."
  - rscadd: "West of the drinking bar is a small lounge."
  - rscadd: "South of the drinking bar, across a hallway, is the kitchen bar; it too has three sides. Within the kitchen bar is a public cooking area (stove/oven/etc.) and a wall locker for storing ingredients.  The dinnerware machine has been made wall-mounted.  Within the kitchen proper, behind curtains, lies a reconfigured kitchen with two cooking stations in the northeast, the supplies on the east wall, and the varied miscellaneous cooking machines have been arranged in the west and south.  The freezer is in the kitchen's southeast corner, compressed to only hold directly meat-processing-related things.  From the freezer, a garden shared with hydroponics is accessible to chefs.  The hydroponics-kitchen desk is on the south wall of the kitchen."
  - rscadd: "West of the kitchen bar is a small shop area, accessible to Cargo, for selling goods in a public area.  It has its own mailing destination in the tagging system."
  - rscadd: "Also west of the kitchen bar is a small table, for eating a little further away from the kitchen bar proper."
  - rscadd: "Southwest of the kitchen bar are two two-person tables, each with doors that can be bolted shut and windows that can be tinted opaque."
  - rscadd: "A jukebox and phonograph have been added to the diner halls.  Testing confirms that playing a song on one turns off the song on the other.  A new door/window subtype, startsopen, has been added that starts open, to contain the jukebox.  Kitchen or bar staff can close it however, in case music privileges are abused."
  - rscadd: "South of the two private rooms is a game room, accesible from the bistro hallway as well as primary hallway; the arcade machines, phonograph, chess, and slot machine have been moved there, and a battlemonsters vendor, manual, regular playing cards, entertainment monitor, and a TV (subtype of wooden_tv that can see all public cameras) have been added.  The shared window between the game room and hydroponics (to the south) can be tinted on either side so that one doesn't see into the other."
  - rscadd: "East of the game room is a larger private table, with boltable doors, and seating for eight around a 3x1 table.  The teapot on the table starts filled with tea."
  - rscadd: "Northeast of the kitchen, accesible behind curtains from the main bistro area, is a smoking lounge with a green table, cigars, and seating for eight, with boltable doors - for all those smoky backroom dealings."
  - rscadd: "North of the smoking lounge is the toilets, behind the same curtains .  In the hall in front of it are drinks and snack machines, including a BODA vendor, which can be removed if the devs will it."
  - rscadd: "A hallway with black and white styling connects the kitchen bar, drinking bar, smoking lounge, private rooms, game room, small lounge, across-kitchen table, shop, and toilets; this is also where all the seating for the kitchen bar, as well as most of the drinking bar, is located.  It is open to the primary hallways with no doors, though emergency shutters and railings do help protect the area."
  - rscadd: "South of the bistro complex is hydroponics.  It is narrower; tables, machinery, and growing trays have been re-arranged in a line for efficiency based on feedback from the community.  At the end of the tray rows is a pool tile (for collecting water).  In the middle south of hydroponics is a secure bee-handling area, more obviously marked for bees, and pre-loaded with bee equipment.  The kitchen-hydroponics desk is on the middle-northeast wall, with the chemistry equipment moved nearby.  A jukebox is near the front door.  There is a ringer terminal system now, since hydroponics is deep enough to not see the desk in some areas.  The shared window between the game room and hydroponics can be tinted on either side so that one doesn't see into the other."
  - rscadd: "East of hydroponics, and south of kitchen freezer, is a shared garden between hydroponics and the kitchen, containing trays, emergency floodlights, basic gardening tools, and crates with chickens, a cow, and a hakhma." 
  - rscadd: "Added a function to pool tiles to be able to fill a container with water from them.  Spray bottles will fill instead of spraying when clicking a water tile."
