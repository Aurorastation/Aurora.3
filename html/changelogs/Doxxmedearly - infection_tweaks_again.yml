changes:
  - tweak: "Wounds are less likely to infect limbs if small or properly treated. Infections should also progress a little less quickly."
  - rscadd: "Added a new medication, Steramycin. If administered before a limb reaches the first infection level, it has a great chance to prevent infection. It has no effect on infections that have progressed to or past level one; it's meant to be used as insurance against infections after being wounded. It does not sterilize wounds, so make sure those are treated (Or the limb may re-infect)! Created with a ratio of 2 Thetamycin to 1 Sterilizine to 1 Radium, and produces 2 units."
