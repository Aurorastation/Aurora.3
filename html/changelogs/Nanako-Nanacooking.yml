changes: 
  - rscadd: "Cooking appliances overhauled majorly. The general flow of cooking has been changed to be less about frantic clicking, and more about time management. All cooking operations now take much longer, but each appliance is capable of doing multiple things synchronously."
  - rscadd: "The fryer and oven now have several removable containers, multiple items can be loaded into each to cook them all at once, combine them into a desired output, or make certain new recipes with them. Multiple containers plus multiple items in each container allows large scale bulk cooking."
  - tweak: "Oven and fryer both now require pre-heating at the start of a round. this takes 10-15 mins and consumes a lot of power. Don't forget to turn them on!"
  - rscadd: "Fryer now has a fairly indepth oil mechanic. Oil levels in the fryer should be kept topped up via a replacement tank, and oil is gradually transferred into food, increasing its nutritional value. Hot oil can also be scooped out and splashed on someone as a decent weapon. A replacement oiltank can sometimes be found in maintenance, otherwise it can be ordered at cargo"
  - tweak: "Oven now has a door that opens and closes. Heat is lost rapidly while its open."
  - rscadd: "The cereal and candy makers now have a single large container, to combine multiple ingredients into cereal or candy."
  - rscadd: "The microwave can now cook multiple copies of the same recipe if all the ingredients are added. And the microwave will no longer produce a burned mess with extra ingredients, as long as there's enough to make a recipe."
  - tweak: "Many recipes are moved out of the microwave and into the oven or fryer."
  - tweak: "Moved to fryer: All donuts, cuban carp"
  - tweak: "Moved to Oven: All breads, flatbread, diona roast, all pies, cookie, fortune cookie, all pizzas, enchiladas, monkey delight, pretzel"
  - tweak: "Combination cooking will now change the size of the resulting food item based on the quantity of stuff used to make it. You can make an epic-sized cake if you find enough ingredients. This doesnt affect normal cooking recipes"
  - rscadd: "Added a battering mechanic. Batter and beer-batter mixes can be created, and food dipped into them before cooking. This adds lots of calories and changes the appearance of food."
  - rscadd: "Added several new recipes, mainly to the fryer. Many of them require batter."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a ton of bugs related to cooking stuff."
  - imageadd: "Adjusted microwave sprites to pulsate while turned on."
