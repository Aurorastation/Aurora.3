changes:
  - tweak: "The Freelancers distress team has had its equipment changed up. Everyone now gets sidearms, the leader getting a revolver and the rest having .45s. The 10mm submachineguns have been swapped for a .45 submachinegun. People who lacked a knife have one now. At the baseline, they're stil one of the weaker ERT's comparatively but no longer major pushovers other than the lead, who has always been good."
  - maptweak: "Freelancers now get some additional equipment if they're rolled. The Distress team base will give them zippos, cigars, holsters, vests and a few weapon racks that will provide random guns to vary up their firepower within reason. No two merc outfits are alike, right?"
