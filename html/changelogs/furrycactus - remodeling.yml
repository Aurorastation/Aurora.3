# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - maptweak: "Moves the Tesla Bay more northward to make it a bit less effected by Supermatter delaminations."
  - maptweak: "Revamps the sublevel breakroom somewhat to incentivise its use a little more. Foyer is largely untouched, save for moving the box of donk pockets."
  - maptweak: "Adds a substation to Engineering's sublevel."
  - maptweak: "Puts the Tesla Coils and Tesla Ball Generator in their proper positions at roundstart to exponentially cut down on start-up time. Hauling literally everything took forever. Now you only need to haul the grounding rods."
  - maptweak: "Changed the colour of the Tesla output wires to blue instead of red. Pretty colours + differentiating it from the main grid."
  - maptweak: "Makes the Tesla Bay APC a supercap critical APC, like the Supermatter engine room, and like the Gravity Generator, instead of the basic one with a shitty 5000 cap 'heavy-duty' cell."
  - maptweak: "Un-fucks the Engineering Storage area designation. Engineering EVA Storage and Hard Storage no longer share the exact same area designation, both with their own APCs for some reason. They're split into their own respective areas, and Sublevel storage has its own area now too."
  - maptweak: "Gives the Robotics Lab a highcap APC, instead of a 5000 'heavy-duty' cell, because they really need it."
  - maptweak: "Splits the entire 'Robotics Lab' area into 'Robotics Lab', 'Robotics Charging Bay', and 'Cyborgification Bay'. This means three APCs for different objects to draw from, rather than having a cell charger, four exosuit chargers, two borg chargers, and the rest of the robotics equipment being on a single APC with a 5000 cap cell inside it."
