  - rscadd: "Psionic jumpstarters now work on skrell, upgrading the user to an antagonist level psion."
  - rscadd: "Added a new lesser version of the psionic jumpstarter, called a psionic awakener, to the uplink. It sets the user to the same level of psionic as a Skrell, while being significantly cheaper than the full jumpstarter."
