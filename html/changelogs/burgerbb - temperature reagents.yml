changes: 
  - experiment: "Added a new system that allows reagents to have their own temperatures. Includes a new unit test for devs."
  - rscadd: "Added a few new reagents; phoron salts, cryosufacant, pyrosilicate. Ice can be created by cooling water, and water can be created by heating ice."
  - rscadd: "Added a new chemistry heater that can cool or heat reagents between a range of a temperature. Vending machines and smartfridges have a temperature setting that can either heat or cool reagents; affected by manipulating wires. Ovens and microwaves automatically heat up the reagents to the recipe's requirement."
  - tweak: "Crewmembers can spawn with either a heated or cooled vacuum flask."
  - rscadd: "Consuming hot reagents raise your body temperature. Cold reagents lower it. Extremely hot or extremely cold reagents can burn you when splashed."
  - tweak: "Tricordrazine heals more brute and less burn when hot, and heals more burn and less brute when cold."
  - bugfix: "Updated clonexadone description to accurately describe what it does. Updated Peridaxon recipe to fix odd recipe logic."
