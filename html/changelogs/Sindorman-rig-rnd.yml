changes: 
  - rscadd: "Robotics lab now can construct RIGs. Currently allowed designs are: EVA, CE, industiral, AMI, hazard(Security), combat, hacker(illegal), stealth(illegal, shitty ninja knockoff). The process of construction is similar to Mechs. Civillian RIGs require wires, central board, steel sheets. Combat(and illegal) RIGS require: wires, central board, control and targeting board, advanced scanning module, steel sheets, plasteel sheets. All circuit boards for RIGS are now in RND research designs. RIG assembly frames need to be researched prior to them showing up in fabricator. For more information check WIKI page about process and other things."
  - tweak: "Hazard suit bullet and radiation armour is slightly increased."
  - tweak: "Industrial suit bullet armour is slightly decreased."
  - tweak: "Stealth suit now has slightly better armour than hacker suit."
  - tweak: "Combat suit armour values have been slightly reduced to be lower than adminbus RIGS."
  - tweak: "Combat suit sprite has been updated to match NT colouring for security. Thanks to Kyres"
