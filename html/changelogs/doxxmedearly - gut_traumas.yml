changes:
  - rscdel: "Removed brain traumas. Medication side or overdose effects that granted traumas instead cause similar effects."
  - tweak: "Mental medications are mostly there for fluff messages (for now). Some retain their mechanical benefits such as helping with hallucinations."
  - rscadd: "Orastabin, Neurapan, and Nerospectan now help ease the effects of the stuttering disability (Though not stuttering due to pain and shock). Orastabin is the most effective."
  - rscdel: "Removed mental medication's withdrawal mechanics. You don't need to pop multiple pills in a shift anymore. This should also fix the nicotine messages."
