changes:
  - rscadd: "Phased out the Phoron fueled PACMAN generators on the Aurora, and replaced them with Uranium and Tritium fueled variants. We're in a scarcity, people! Engineering no longer has solid Phoron sheets, but has been supplied with Uranium sheets and Tritium bars. (For those curious, you can smelt Hydrogen ore to get Tritium bars; the stuff you normally compress for Metallic Hydrogen.)"
  - spellcheck: "Adjusted the description of the PACMAN generators, and their names, to make it more clear what fuel they take and their various consequences for improper use under Space OH&S."
  - balance: "Tweaked the way that PACMAN generators work slightly. Phoron powered PACMAN generators now produce the most power, but consume their fuel the quickest, and have a more devastating outcome should they overheat. Uranium fueled PACMANs are unchanged, but they produce the same amount of power that Phoron ones used to and are the most fuel efficient, however they produce very small amounts of radiation when active, and give a heavy burst of radiation if they explode from overheat. Tritium fueled PACMANs are unchanged, however they produce more power than Uranium, but less than Phoron. They don't produce radiation, but the scale of damage they cause if they overheat is extensive."
  - maptweak: "Very slightly changed the layout of the command bunker to tidy some wires and pipes."
