# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - backend: "Reagents now use /decl/s instead of /datum/s."
  - refactor: "Paint no longer has a color of its own and can instead be combined with other reagents to make colours stick to things. Colorific!"
  - rscadd: "Blood is now body temperature."
  - tweak: "Injecting incompatible blood now creates a special toxin rather than the actual toxin chemical."
  - rscadd: "Ports Bay's per-mob dose system. This will probably affect how much alcohol you have to drink to get/stay drunk."
  - rscdel: "Replaces the chem modifier system with CE_EFFECT. Funny, given that it was originally intended to be the other way around."
  - tweak: "Hot chemicals now do more damage; before, it would be rounded down to zero or outhealed in one tick."
  - tweak: "Temperature is no longer per-reagent; it is now per-reagents-datum."
  - rscdel: "Removes phoron salts pending a rework/replacement."
  - tweak: "Having a chemical that is toxic to an organ in your system will now prevent that organ from regenerating."
