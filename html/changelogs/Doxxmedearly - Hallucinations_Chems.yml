changes: 
  - tweak: "Synaptizine, methylphenidate, risperidone and olanzapine will reduce overall hallucination duration, reduce frequency of hallucination effects, and sometimes prevent them entirely. Useful!"
  - tweak: "Some hallucinogenic drugs and toxins will now increase the duration you hallucinate and make effects happen more frequently."
  - tweak: "Wulumunusha will now cause skrell to experience light hallucinations (as its description implies) at dosages greater than 10u."
  - bugfix: "Fixed null hallucinations causing runtimes. Hopefully."
