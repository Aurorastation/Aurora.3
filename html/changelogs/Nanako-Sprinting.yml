changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a new sprinting mechanic. Moving in run mode is now much faster, but limited by stamina or a special species mechanic. Sprinting works slightly differently for each species."
  - tweak: "Moving in walk mode is now as fast as run used to be. Walk is the new default speed."
  - rscadd: "Added a walkspeed limiting feature. Use Limit Walk Speed in the IC tab, or alt+click on the walk/run button to bring up a menu. This allows limiting your walk speed very precisely to any value below normal. It can only slow you down, will not increase speed."
  - tweak: "Natural recovery of suffocation damage is now slower."
  - rscadd: "Alcohol, caffienated drinks, and several performance enhancing drugs now have interactions with movement, sprinting and stamina."
