# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Replaced the 'Revolutionaries' with 'The Contenders', a more neutral term that will hopefully make it easier for them to recruit in the Crew."
  - tweak: "Replaced the 'Loyalists' with 'The Fellowship', which should leave them as the more friendly sounding of the two yet still be much less pro-Command."
  - imageadd: "Added two brand new hud icons with these differences in mind. Made better ones afterall and had to change this entry."
  - tweak: "Gave the Contenders and Fellowship both their own uplinks and TC, and I removed the Old Loyalist ability to recruit mindshielded persons and them starting with a Head. This should lead to a more even round."
