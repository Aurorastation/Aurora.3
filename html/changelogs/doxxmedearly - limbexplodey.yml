changes: 
  - tweak: "Adjusted how explosive implants are set. You will no longer get the settings prompts when injecting. Use them in-hand to change the settings, instead."
  - tweak: "When you put an explosive implant into an implanter, it tells you the setting and trigger phrase. If you did not set a phrase, it will generate and give you a fallback code word."
  - tweak: "Explosive implants now spawn out of the implanter when the box is ordered from the uplink, to make it easier to use in-hand. Uplink description edited to inform people how to use it."
  - bugfix: "Localized limb settings for explosive implants no longer gib the person. They just explode the limb. They can now explode outside a person's body, but it won't do much."
