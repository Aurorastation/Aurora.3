changes:
  - rscadd: "When converting someone as a cultist, they now have an option to ghost. This will spawn a filled soulstone which you can use to create a construct. Jobbanned people also get stoned."
  - rscadd: "Ghosting as a cult shade or construct will now open a ghost role, which allows any ghost to seamlessly fill your spot with no admin intervention."
  - tweak: "Using a forging rune will no longer grant constructs a full HP revive, instead, the HP value will be carried over to the new construct."
  - bugfix: "You can now attack shades with any sort of item."
  - bugfix: "Fixed blood overlays on cult shades and constructs."
