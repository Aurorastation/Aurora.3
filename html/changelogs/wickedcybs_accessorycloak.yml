changes:
  - tweak: "The Tajara commoner/royal cloaks are renamed to 'common cloak' and 'fancy cloak' respectively and can be attached as accessories or just be worn in the suit slot like other cloak/cape style items now. A minor change was made to the fancy cloak to make it look more consistent with the common one."
