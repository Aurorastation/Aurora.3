# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

changes:
  - bugfix: "The Francisca is now actually a gatling gun as it was meant to be. When fired, it spawns eight extra projectiles."
  - tweak: "Francisca normal ammo now has 1 more penetration so that it actually gets through hulls."
  - bugfix: "Maneuvers now work correctly. Do note that the left/right distinction is relative to ship direction ONLY for combat rolls, whereas it is absolute for combat turning (imagine a compass)."
  - bugfix: "Physical ship ammunition projectiles now have hit sound effects."
  - bugfix: "Ship weapon projectiles no longer miss when they enter a ship. Get down if you want to dodge them!"
