changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added Monoammonium Phosphate, a reagent that excels in extinguishing fires, and acts as a fertilizer. They are now found in fire extinguishers instead of water. Added Monoammonium Phosphate tanks around the station in place of some water tanks."
  - rscadd: "Added a new weak chem sprayer, 'Xenoblaster', which can be found in xenobiology for xenobiologists."
  - tweak: "Fire extinguishers can be filled with any reagent using a fire extinguisher cartridge. Fire extinguisher cartridges can be ordered by cargo, or found in atmospherics."
  - tweak: "Reagent dispensers, such as watertanks and beer kegs, can now be filled with any reagent. Fuel tanks are an exception." 
  - tweak: "Reworked how reagent containers (glass beakers, drinks) behave on interaction. You can splash anyone with any container on harm intent, does not work on other intents."
  - maptweak: "Removed pointless reinforced plating in engineering maintenance and the janitor's closet. Removed the Security Intercomm in atmospherics. Added a fire storage area in atmospherics that contains firefighting equipment."
