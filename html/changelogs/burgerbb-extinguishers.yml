changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added Monoammonium Phosphate, a reagent that excels in extinguishing fires, and acts as a fertilizer. They are now found in fire extinguishers instead of water. Added Monoammonium Phosphate tanks around the station in place of some water tanks."
  - rscadd: "Added a new weak chem sprayer, 'Xenoblaster', which can be found in xenobiology for xenobiologists."
  - tweak: "Fire extinguishers can be filled with any reagent using an extinguisher cartridge. Extinguisher cartridges can be ordered by cargo, or found in atmospherics."
  - tweak: "Reagent dispensers, such as watertanks and beer kegs, can now be filled with any reagent. Fuel tanks are an exception."
  - rscadd: "Most mobile reagent dispensers can leak their contents if you use harm intent wrench on them. Changed how leaking works."
  - tweak: "Reworked how reagent containers (glass beakers, drinks) behave on interaction. You can splash anyone with any container on harm intent, and drink/use them on other intents."
  - maptweak: "Added a fire storage area in atmospherics that contains firefighting equipment and Monoammonium Phosphate containers."
  - rscadd: "Lube and water can be spread to other tiles if there is too much water or lube on one tile."
