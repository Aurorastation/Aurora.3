changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added Monoammonium Phosphate, a reagent that excels in extinguishing fires, and acts as a fertilizer. They are now found in fire extinguishers instead of water. Added Monoammonium Phosphate tanks around the station. Added a 'Fire Storage' room in Atmospherics that contains 3 large cardox grenades, and a bunch of firefighting equipment."
  - tweak: "Fire extinguishers and all sorts of tanks (Fuel Tanks, Water Tanks) can be filled with any reagent."
  - bugfix: "Removed the Security Intercomm in atmospherics."
