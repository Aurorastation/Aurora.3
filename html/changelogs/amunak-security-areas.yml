changes:
  - rscadd: "Added low level APCs (with just a regular battery), to be used in offices and other smaller, less critical areas. This allows long-term power loss to be of some consequence. Mapped into the security areas."
  - maptweak: "Split upper security (investigations & training) into multiple per-room areas as it should be. Added light switches and APCs for those areas."
  - maptweak: "The room with stairs to Training is now a part of the Training area, not Brig."
  - maptweak: "Evidence Storage is now its own area as well."
  - maptweak: "From security/brig there were two rooms split: the 'control room' and 'processing'. Also added APCs."
  - tweak: "Added back the option to toggle lights to most Security areas (basically everything but places where prisoners are held)."
  - tweak: "Added/modified area icons for most of the areas mentioned above for easier mapping."
