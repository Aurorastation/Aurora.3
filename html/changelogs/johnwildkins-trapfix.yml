# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - refactor: "Traps have been overhauled on the back-end, and their interactions simplified to the end-user."
  - tweak: "Large traps must now be anchored and then set before use. The process takes three seconds with a wrench and five seconds with an open hand respectively. Large traps can only deploy once anchored."
  - tweak: "You can place someone/thing into a large trap (via buckling) regardless of the trap's deployment."
  - bugfix: "You can once again anchor large traps to the floor with a wrench."
  - bugfix: "Fixed certain parts of the trap capture event not firing depending on the method of capture."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer teleport inside of traps by attempting to sneak through them from a long distance away."
