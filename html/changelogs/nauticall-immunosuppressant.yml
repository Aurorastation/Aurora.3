# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new immunosuppressant drug, Cytophenolate. It slowly but surely mitigates the effects of organ damage above 10 units and cures organ rejection after some timestamps."
  - balance: "Cytophenolate does not fully cure rejected transplanted organs from other species; it only prevents the effects from worsening as long as the drug is in their system."
  - balance: "Cytophenolate is an actual immunosuppressant, and reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics while in a patient's system."
