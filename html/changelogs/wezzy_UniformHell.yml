changes:
  - rscadd: "The new departmental uniforms can have their sleeves rolled up now."
  - tweak: "Tweaks jumpsuit rolling code, so only the verb is available if rolled state actually exists."
  - rscadd: "The new departmental uniforms have been tweaked in several places to be more differentiated."
  - rscdel: "Captain, Bridge Crew and Executive Officers spawn with oxford shoes instead of sneakers."
  - rscadd: "Wardens, officers and cadets have new hats, vests and jackets to differentiate themselves further."

  - rscdel: "Removed generic corporate hats. (For anyone that's asking, they're the black and really dark blue hats that were actually unaffliated with any corporation.)"
  - rscdel: "Removed first responder outfit, mime, depreciated uniforms and alternate detective outfits. (They did not fit in with any of the uniforms.)"
  - rscadd: "Corporatizes the scrubs selection and adds more choices. Color coordination!"
  - rscdel: "Scrubbed superfluous megacorp uniforms from the loadout. (You're already spawning in with your uniform anyway.)"

  - rscadd: "Adds proper IDs for Orion Express employees."
  - bugfix: "Fixes some corporate jobs not spawning with labcoats."
