changes:
  - tweak: "Diona limb regeneration is now progress based instead of a 10 minute timer. Light contributes low amount to progress, biomass(nutrition) contributes medium amount. Radiation contributes big amount. In comparison Diona will regenerate within 10 minutes with just light and having no biomass stored beforehand. Diona who has decent amount of biomass stored will regenerate within 5 minutes. Consuming food like cow while regenerating will take 2 minutes to regenerate limb. Diona who is in light, has biomass stored and has radiation emitting at it will take 1-1.5 minutes to regenerate limb."
  - tweak: "Status panel now shows stats for Diona like how much biomass, and energy are stored out of maximum. And regeneration process of a limb."
