changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds secondary IV bags for Medical/Chemistry to use, so there's a viable IV alternative for patients besides syringes/bottles on IV stands."
  - bugfix: "Makes sure you can only place sane containers on IV stands (closed beakers, bottles, IV bags, etc. NO FOOD!)"
  - tweak: "Replaces inaprovaline autoinjectors with epinephrine autoinjectors in preparation for later updates, and in an attempt to phase out inaprovaline somewhat."
