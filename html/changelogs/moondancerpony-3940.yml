changes: 
  - tweak: "Preparing a brain to be placed in an MMI now requires a cranial cavity to be created before performing the preparation surgery. This means you'll no longer lobotomise someone when trying to implant something in their head."
  - bugfix: "IPCs should now be able to have things implanted again."
  - bugfix: "A factory defect in the prosthetic painting equipment at several factories has been fixed. This means IPCs should no longer have miscolored prosthetic limbs."
