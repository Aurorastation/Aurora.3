  - maptweak: "The month of a certain over-commercialised holiday and tacky decorations has begun. NanoTrasen has seen fit to leave no public hall, break room, Head of Staff (+Quartermaster, how generous) office spared of holiday decor, and no Civilian department workspace bare of tacky flashing holiday lights. They even put a gaudily decorated tree in the bar, with gifts layed under it every shift. Show some holiday spirit, and spend money on the newest flashiest devices for your friends and family."
