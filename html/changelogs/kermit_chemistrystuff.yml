changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed neurotoxic chemicals doing no damage. Neurotoxic chemicals will prevent Alkysine from working unless Dylovene is also in the system."
  - tweak: "All neurotoxic chemicals have had their numbers tweaked to ensure they don't nuke the brain."
  - tweak: "Tweaked effects and added flavour messages for many, if not all, the recreational drugs. Affected drugs include Psilocybin, Raskara Dust, Krok Juice, Nightlife, Space Drugs (now Mercury Monolithium Sucrose & Ambrosia Extract) Mortaphenyl, Oxycomorphine, Hyperzine, Stimm, Mindbreaker Toxin, and Wulumunusha."
  - rscadd: "Split Space Drugs into Mercury Monolithium Sucrose and Ambrosia Extract. MMS remains the chemical precursor for various mental reagents; Ambrosia Extract is a lite version of MMS found in Ambrosia."
  - rscadd: "Added another recreational drug: Joy (1 part Neurapan, 2 parts Oxycomorphine). Also available on the Traitor Uplink in the Random Toxin Vial."
  - tweak: "Ammonia/fertilisers can be tossed onto people to deal minor burn damage. A cheap tool for traitors or an accident waiting to happen in Hydroponics."
  - tweak: "Space Cleaner and Sterilisine now have toxic properties if ingested in large doses. Another cheap tool for traitors. Accidentally spraying someone (even multiple times) isn't going to hurt them, don't worry."
  - rscadd: "Added Xu'xi Gas, a recreational drug hailing from Qerr'Malic that must be inhaled. It produces a mild high similar to Wulumunusha and is known to make users susceptible to persuasion. Recipe: 2 parts Dexalin, 2 parts Mercury Monolithium Sucrose, 1 part Truth Serum (reagents heated to 137'C)."
  - rscadd: "Added Co'qnixq Wuxi, a skrell nootropic/'smart drug' which enhances cognitive function & memory recollection/gain. It increases psionic stamina by 25% while metabolising. Recipe: 1 part Wulumunusha, 1 part Synaptizine, 1 part Emoxanyl."
  - tweak: "Tweaked glass bottle/beaker examine code to show whether the reagent is a gas/liquid/solid (before it only showed solids)."
  - tweak: "Wall Nano-Meds now also have dylovene autoinjectors alongside the inaprovaline autoinjectors."
