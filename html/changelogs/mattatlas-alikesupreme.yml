# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - balance: "Damage values of 7.62, 5.56 and midlasers have been all nerfed."
  - balance: "Security's ballistic and ablative armour have been heavily nerfed. They now only block around 5 more damage, instead of blocking over half."
  - balance: "Combat stims' chems have been compacted into one new chem, Kilosemine, with increased metabolisation rate (0.6u/tick) and without the effects of Oxycomorphine. Combat hyposprays start with ten units, which can be spread out across two injections."
  - balance: "Personal shields no longer recharge on their own. They have a cell, which can be recharged and cannot be manually replaced. Passive upkeep is 2 charge every 2 seconds or so, whereas blocking a bullet is 200 charge per shot. Their size has been reduced to normal, so they can fit in backpacks."
