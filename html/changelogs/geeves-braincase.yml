changes:
  - rscadd: "MMIs have been redone to be braincases instead of simple brain-cradles. They have a new description and a new process of completion. Examining it will give you step-by-step instructions. You no longer need to prepare the brain externally either."
  - tweak: "Brain lobotomization has been renamed to be brain preparation."
