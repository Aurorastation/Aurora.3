      put any commentary good or bad, here.
  - tweak: Some maintenance doors within RnD and Medbay have had their accesses changed.
      Maintenance doors in the joint areas (leading to the research shuttle, virology,
      and xenobiology) are now zero access. Which means anyone in those joints can
      enter the maintenance tunnels. This was done to add additional evacuation locations
      during radiation storms. Additional maintenance doors were added to the tunnels
      in these areas to prevent docs and scientists from running about.
  - tweak: Starboard emergency storage isn't gone now, it's simply located in the
      escape wing.
  - experiment: An engineering training room has been added to engineering. This location
      was previously where surgery was located. If you are new to engineering or need
      to brush up on your skills, please use this area for testing.

  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Rewrote tables. To construct a table, use steel to make a table frame,
      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Adds tail animations for tajaran and unathi. Animations are controlled
      using emotes.

      injected (syringes, IV drips), and put on the skin (sprays, beaker splashing).
  - tweak: Injecting food and drinks will cause bad effects.
  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.
  - tweak: Toxins now work slower and deal more damage. Seek medical help!

2015-05-22:
  Ccomp5950:

  - bugfix: Goats will eat the spawning plants for vines as well as the vines themselves.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Ghetto diagnosis. Grab patient, aim at bodypart you want to check, click
      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.
  - rscadd: Stethoscopes actually make sense now. They care for heart/lungs status
      when reporting pulse and respiration now.
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Re-implemented fuel fires. Tweaked fire behaviour overall.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Bear traps now do damage when stood on, enough to break bones! Bear traps
      can now affect any limb of a person who is on the ground, including head! Bear
      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.
  - rscadd: Tables are now built via steel then another sheet on the resulting frame.
      They can then be reinforced by dragging a stack of sheets onto the table.

      a final sheet.

      configured how long clients may remain inactive before being kicked.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs
      et al to pass though.

      Server Revision' verb in the OOC category.

      as something else while their body lives.

  - bugfix: Split stacks no longer lose their coloring.
  - tweak: Can no longer merge cables of different colors.
2015-06-19:

  - rscadd: Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown.
  - tweak: Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent.
  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.
  - wip: Adds docking to the mercenary shuttle. Works similarly to other shuttles,
      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain
      amount, and will inflict paincrit effects instead. On most humaniods the head,
      chest, and groin are vital.
  - rscadd: 'Engineers now spawn with industrial workboots (credit: ChessPiece/Bishop).'
  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug preventing internal organs from taking damage in some cases.
  - maptweak: New flavours of tables around the station. Engineering starts with more
      plastic.
  - bugfix: Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and
      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces
      lag and gives antags a larger window of opportunity to disable suit sensors
      if they have to harm someone.

  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Pariahs are now a subspecies of Vox with less atmos/cold protection, a
      useless brain, and lower health.
  - rscadd: Leap now only gives a passive grab and has a shorter range. It also stuns
      Pariahs longer than it does their target.
2015-09-05:
  Zuhayr:
  - bugfix: Auto-traitor should now be fixed.
  - bugfix: The Secret game mode should now be fixed.
