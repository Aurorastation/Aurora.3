  GinjaNinja32:

      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.

  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.

      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.

      configured how long clients may remain inactive before being kicked.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs

  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.

      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain

  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.

      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces

      if they have to harm someone.
2015-08-17:
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      Pariahs longer than it does their target.
2015-09-05:

      that you can delete. You can also make new characters.'

      if they merge or grow into one. Nymphs splitting from a gestalt have a chance
      to inherit each language, otherwise they will forget it. Forgetting how to speak
      or understand basic is possible.

      they must learn basic. In addition, all diona have rootsong as their default
      language on roundstart.

  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.

      speech) to surround mark-up markers for them to be valid. "/this will/ work,"
      "as /will/ this," ":s/and this./" But, "/this will not /work." This enables
      you to use words with underscores in them, and to type type-paths and other
      things in BYOND.
  - bugfix: Mark-up no longer nukes BYOND server addresses.
  - tweak: IPCs now have a very minor chance of getting shocked from feeding on APCs.

      the global default explosion type.

      was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency
      of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things
      to actually do.
  - maptweak: The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart
      viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power
      cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components
      now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and
      made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid
      SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can
      output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the
      station on its own, and then some.
  - maptweak: Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line
      with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks.

      full First and Last name in order for ED to arrest/detain tha person, either
      first of Last works.
  - rscadd: ED 209 now has a verb that lets you to set its nickname to which he will
      respond. So that you can call it something like 'ED', etc. It will not change
      its name however. Also only people with access and who are not set to arrest
      can use that verb.

  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: All wieldable weapons are now wielded via the Wield Firearm verb, or wield-firearm

      Light contributes low amount to progress, biomass(nutrition) contributes medium
      amount. Radiation contributes big amount. In comparison Diona will regenerate
      within 10 minutes with just light and having no biomass stored beforehand. Diona
      who has decent amount of biomass stored will regenerate within 5 minutes. Consuming
      food like cow while regenerating will take 2 minutes to regenerate limb. Diona
      who is in light, has biomass stored and has radiation emitting at it will take
      1-1.5 minutes to regenerate limb.

      are stored out of maximum. And regeneration process of a limb.

  Skull132:

2019-07-26:
  MoondancerPony:

      injected or if it goes through wounds.
  - rscadd: Certain reagents, like any kind of alcohol, space cleaner, sterilizine,
      honey, and to a very, VERY small extent water, will disinfect wounds when used
      on rags.
  - rscadd: Deflated lungs can be treated, in an emergency, by clicking someone with
      a syringe with the chest targeted and grab intent enabled. Doing so again will
      damage the lungs and reverse the treatment.

  - rscadd: Mixing bowls can be printed from the autolathe.

      have a small chance of causing side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
  - rscadd: Antivirals (deltamivir) have replaced spaceacillin and do mostly the same

      viruses between successive uses (on humans); it's recommended to throw them
      away in the new sharps bins. If they are only used to transfer reagents, they
      can be used indefinitely. Ported from Virgo.
  - maptweak: Medical, Virology, and Xenobiology all have sharps bins for disposal
      of biohazardous glassware.
  - tweak: There are now three hyposprays in the Medical sublevel, which are equivalent
      to syringes prior to this update. They take the same amount of time to inject,
      and have a capacity of 15 units, but are reusable.
  - backend: Accidentally refactored (almost) all storage items to use the starts_with
      var instead of overriding fill(). This should make it a lot less complicated
      to add new storage boxes.
  - imageadd: Modifies sprites for syringes, done by Geeves.
  - rscadd: Adds medicine cups to take medicine by mouth in a dignified manner.
  - tweak: Changes the glycerol recipe. One unit of triglycerides (can be obtained

      storage, it's now in the vault. It's a combat hardsuit, it shouldn't be available
      to any crewmember with EVA access.
  - maptweak: Moves the Tesla Bay more northward to make it a bit less effected by
      Supermatter delaminations.
  - maptweak: Revamps the sublevel breakroom somewhat to incentivise its use a little
      more. Foyer is largely untouched, save for moving the box of donk pockets.
  - maptweak: Adds a substation to Engineering's sublevel.
  - maptweak: Puts the Tesla Coils and Tesla Ball Generator in their proper positions
      at roundstart to exponentially cut down on start-up time. Hauling literally
      everything took forever. Now you only need to haul the grounding rods.
  - maptweak: Changed the colour of the Tesla output wires to blue instead of red.
      Pretty colours + differentiating it from the main grid.
  - maptweak: Makes the Tesla Bay APC a supercap critical APC, like the Supermatter
      engine room, and like the Gravity Generator, instead of the basic one with a
      shitty 5000 cap 'heavy-duty' cell.
  - maptweak: Un-fucks the Engineering Storage area designation. Engineering EVA Storage
      and Hard Storage no longer share the exact same area designation, both with
      their own APCs for some reason. They're split into their own respective areas,
      and Sublevel storage has its own area now too.
  - maptweak: Gives the Robotics Lab a highcap APC, instead of a 5000 'heavy-duty'
      cell, because they really need it.
  - maptweak: Splits the entire 'Robotics Lab' area into 'Robotics Lab', 'Robotics
      Charging Bay', and 'Cyborgification Bay'. This means three APCs for different
      objects to draw from, rather than having a cell charger, four exosuit chargers,
      two borg chargers, and the rest of the robotics equipment being on a single
      APC with a 5000 cap cell inside it.
  - maptweak: Renames the 'emergency singularity beacon' in Engineering Hard Storage
      to 'emergency tesla beacon', for clarity, and because we don't use a Singularity
      on the Aurora.

      of the trap's deployment.

  - tweak: Interacting with space A/Cs is slightly different. If the panel is closed
      and you click it, it brings up the interface menu, which allows you to turn
      it on and off, as well as adjust the temperature. Before, the panel needed to
      be opened for you to adjust the temperature.
  - tweak: Power cells in space A/Cs are no longer removed via menu; if the panel
      is open, you only need to click with an empty hand to remove it, or click with

      carpotoxin, soporific, and phoron.
  - rscadd: Dextrotoxin briefly makes it hard to walk straight before paralyzing you.
      People under the effects of dextrotoxin cannot move or use the radio, but can
      still speak.

  MattAtlas, MoondancerPony, Geeves:
  - experiment: An entirely new medical system! Holy balls that's a lot of changes.

  - tweak: Inaprovaline has been renamed to norepinephrine and viceversa.
  - tweak: CPR has been fixed up a bit. It has a small chance to restart hearts and

  - rscadd: Humans no longer die when hitting 200 damage. Dionae, IPCs, grues and
      zombies are exceptions.
  - rscadd: Humans now die when their brain dies. For the brain to die, it must not
      have oxygen for quite a while.
  - rscadd: Suffocation damage is now a modifier to blood. If you don't have much
      oxygen, then you'll get the effects of low blood.
  - rscadd: Toxins now directly target organs. They'll try to destroy the liver and
      kidneys first... then move onto other organs. Be careful.
  - rscadd: All organs in the body now work towards making sure the brain lives. The
      liver filters toxins, the kidneys do the same, the lungs provide oxygen, the
      heart pumps blood and so on.
  - rscadd: 'Humans now have two new stats: blood oxygenation and blood pressure,
      shown on sensors and scanners. Blood pressure depends on how well your heart
      is pumping your blood. Blood oxygenation depends on how well your blood is oxygenated.'
  - rscadd: Your heart can now stop when your pulse is too high. Your pulse depends
      on many factors - like pain or how much blood your brain wants. A heart in asystole
      cannot pump blood, meaning your brain will suffocate.
  - rscadd: When your heart stops, you go into asystole, aka flatlining. This can
      be fixed with CPR. Make sure that you fix the causes first... or they'll just
      go into asystole again.
  - rscadd: Norepinephrine stabilizes your heartrate. This is a VERY important fact,
      do NOT forget this. Norepinephrine will be your best tool!

      1u antihistamine 1u synaptizine 1u water.

      reagents from the blood.
  - rscadd: New side effects to most healing chems. Be careful.
  - rscadd: Deltamivir now inflicts a fever. Be careful, going overboard with the
      dosage can give you a pretty bad one. Try not to go over 20 units at once.
  - rscadd: Bicaridine now gives you muscle spasms.
  - rscadd: Kelotane makes you drop your held items. Dermaline does the same, as it
      is now a subtype.
  - rscadd: Throwing beakers now shatters them. Be careful.
  - rscdel: Numbers have been deleted from scanners. Mostly. Stop using terms like
      brute and burn damage, boys.
  - rscadd: Taking a good chunk of damage at once now produces adrenaline. Acts like
      a painkiller and raises your pulse. Might also restart your heart.
  - tweak: Soulstones work only when someone's in asystole.
  - tweak: Changed how getting organ damage works. Lasers now deal organ damage.
  - tweak: Most organs can now take more punishment.
  - tweak: The head is now harder to hit.
  - tweak: The organ damage dealt now depends on the size of the organ in the area
      you hit.
  - tweak: Surgery pain is MUCH higher if you're awake.
  - tweak: Self surgery works again.
  - tweak: Using a scalpel on necrotic organs now fixes the necrosis. However, it'll
      also lower the organ's max damage as well.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - bugfix: Circuitry goggles have a sprite again now.

  - rscadd: Added nitrile glove variants for Unathi and Tajara.
  - maptweak: Replaced most instances of latex gloves with nitrile gloves, and made
      xeno variants far more accessible. Latex allergies are no joke, kids.

      instead of white.

2019-12-13:
  Doxxmedearly:
  - tweak: Pets have more discipline regarding food. They will no longer beg for food,
      seek it out, run towards it, steal it, or eat like there's an endless void in
      their stomachs. They'll still eat food on their tile if sufficiently hungry,
      and you can still feed pets by hand, if you'd like. Chefs, rejoice!
  - tweak: Corgi stomach capacity adjusted to a way more sane level.
  - rscdel: Removed guilty messages about pets starving when you examine them; they
      won't go hungry in a single shift, don't worry.
  - rscadd: You can brush most friendly animals. Combs work for fuzzy and feathered
      animals, rags work on other ones.
  - tweak: There's a small chance that when you pet a guard dog (like Columbo) on
      help intent (and aren't his master), he won't immediately maul your face off;
      instead, he will growl at you to warn you not to do that. I still don't recommend
      it.
  - tweak: Like other pets, baby carp can eat now. But not a lot.
  - bugfix: You'll no longer spray yourself with bottles or pepperspray when placing
