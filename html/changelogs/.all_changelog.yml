  GinjaNinja32:

      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.

  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.

      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.

      configured how long clients may remain inactive before being kicked.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs

  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.

      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain

  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.

      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces

      if they have to harm someone.
2015-08-17:
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      Pariahs longer than it does their target.
2015-09-05:

      that you can delete. You can also make new characters.'

      if they merge or grow into one. Nymphs splitting from a gestalt have a chance
      to inherit each language, otherwise they will forget it. Forgetting how to speak
      or understand basic is possible.

      they must learn basic. In addition, all diona have rootsong as their default
      language on roundstart.

  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.

      speech) to surround mark-up markers for them to be valid. "/this will/ work,"
      "as /will/ this," ":s/and this./" But, "/this will not /work." This enables
      you to use words with underscores in them, and to type type-paths and other
      things in BYOND.
  - bugfix: Mark-up no longer nukes BYOND server addresses.
  - tweak: IPCs now have a very minor chance of getting shocked from feeding on APCs.

      the global default explosion type.

      was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency
      of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things
      to actually do.
  - maptweak: The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart
      viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power
      cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components
      now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and
      made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid
      SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can
      output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the
      station on its own, and then some.
  - maptweak: Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line
      with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks.

      full First and Last name in order for ED to arrest/detain tha person, either
      first of Last works.
  - rscadd: ED 209 now has a verb that lets you to set its nickname to which he will
      respond. So that you can call it something like 'ED', etc. It will not change
      its name however. Also only people with access and who are not set to arrest
      can use that verb.
