  GinjaNinja32:

      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.

  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.

      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.

      configured how long clients may remain inactive before being kicked.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs

  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.

      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain

  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.

      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces

      if they have to harm someone.
2015-08-17:
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      Pariahs longer than it does their target.
2015-09-05:

      that you can delete. You can also make new characters.'

      if they merge or grow into one. Nymphs splitting from a gestalt have a chance
      to inherit each language, otherwise they will forget it. Forgetting how to speak
      or understand basic is possible.

      they must learn basic. In addition, all diona have rootsong as their default
      language on roundstart.

  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.

      speech) to surround mark-up markers for them to be valid. "/this will/ work,"
      "as /will/ this," ":s/and this./" But, "/this will not /work." This enables
      you to use words with underscores in them, and to type type-paths and other
      things in BYOND.
  - bugfix: Mark-up no longer nukes BYOND server addresses.
  - tweak: IPCs now have a very minor chance of getting shocked from feeding on APCs.

      the global default explosion type.

      was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency
      of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things
      to actually do.
  - maptweak: The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart
      viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power
      cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components
      now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and
      made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid
      SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can
      output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the
      station on its own, and then some.
  - maptweak: Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line
      with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks.

      full First and Last name in order for ED to arrest/detain tha person, either
      first of Last works.
  - rscadd: ED 209 now has a verb that lets you to set its nickname to which he will
      respond. So that you can call it something like 'ED', etc. It will not change
      its name however. Also only people with access and who are not set to arrest
      can use that verb.

  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: All wieldable weapons are now wielded via the Wield Firearm verb, or wield-firearm

      Light contributes low amount to progress, biomass(nutrition) contributes medium
      amount. Radiation contributes big amount. In comparison Diona will regenerate
      within 10 minutes with just light and having no biomass stored beforehand. Diona
      who has decent amount of biomass stored will regenerate within 5 minutes. Consuming
      food like cow while regenerating will take 2 minutes to regenerate limb. Diona
      who is in light, has biomass stored and has radiation emitting at it will take
      1-1.5 minutes to regenerate limb.

      are stored out of maximum. And regeneration process of a limb.

  Skull132:

2019-07-26:
  MoondancerPony:

      injected or if it goes through wounds.
  - rscadd: Certain reagents, like any kind of alcohol, space cleaner, sterilizine,
      honey, and to a very, VERY small extent water, will disinfect wounds when used
      on rags.
  - rscadd: Deflated lungs can be treated, in an emergency, by clicking someone with
      a syringe with the chest targeted and grab intent enabled. Doing so again will
      damage the lungs and reverse the treatment.

  - rscadd: Mixing bowls can be printed from the autolathe.

      have a small chance of causing side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
  - rscadd: Antivirals (deltamivir) have replaced spaceacillin and do mostly the same

      viruses between successive uses (on humans); it's recommended to throw them
      away in the new sharps bins. If they are only used to transfer reagents, they
      can be used indefinitely. Ported from Virgo.
  - maptweak: Medical, Virology, and Xenobiology all have sharps bins for disposal
      of biohazardous glassware.
  - tweak: There are now three hyposprays in the Medical sublevel, which are equivalent
      to syringes prior to this update. They take the same amount of time to inject,
      and have a capacity of 15 units, but are reusable.
  - backend: Accidentally refactored (almost) all storage items to use the starts_with
      var instead of overriding fill(). This should make it a lot less complicated
      to add new storage boxes.
  - imageadd: Modifies sprites for syringes, done by Geeves.
  - rscadd: Adds medicine cups to take medicine by mouth in a dignified manner.
  - tweak: Changes the glycerol recipe. One unit of triglycerides (can be obtained

      storage, it's now in the vault. It's a combat hardsuit, it shouldn't be available
      to any crewmember with EVA access.
  - maptweak: Moves the Tesla Bay more northward to make it a bit less effected by
      Supermatter delaminations.
  - maptweak: Revamps the sublevel breakroom somewhat to incentivise its use a little
      more. Foyer is largely untouched, save for moving the box of donk pockets.
  - maptweak: Adds a substation to Engineering's sublevel.
  - maptweak: Puts the Tesla Coils and Tesla Ball Generator in their proper positions
      at roundstart to exponentially cut down on start-up time. Hauling literally
      everything took forever. Now you only need to haul the grounding rods.
  - maptweak: Changed the colour of the Tesla output wires to blue instead of red.
      Pretty colours + differentiating it from the main grid.
  - maptweak: Makes the Tesla Bay APC a supercap critical APC, like the Supermatter
      engine room, and like the Gravity Generator, instead of the basic one with a
      shitty 5000 cap 'heavy-duty' cell.
  - maptweak: Un-fucks the Engineering Storage area designation. Engineering EVA Storage
      and Hard Storage no longer share the exact same area designation, both with
      their own APCs for some reason. They're split into their own respective areas,
      and Sublevel storage has its own area now too.
  - maptweak: Gives the Robotics Lab a highcap APC, instead of a 5000 'heavy-duty'
      cell, because they really need it.
  - maptweak: Splits the entire 'Robotics Lab' area into 'Robotics Lab', 'Robotics
      Charging Bay', and 'Cyborgification Bay'. This means three APCs for different
      objects to draw from, rather than having a cell charger, four exosuit chargers,
      two borg chargers, and the rest of the robotics equipment being on a single
      APC with a 5000 cap cell inside it.
  - maptweak: Renames the 'emergency singularity beacon' in Engineering Hard Storage
      to 'emergency tesla beacon', for clarity, and because we don't use a Singularity
      on the Aurora.

      of the trap's deployment.

  - tweak: Interacting with space A/Cs is slightly different. If the panel is closed
      and you click it, it brings up the interface menu, which allows you to turn
      it on and off, as well as adjust the temperature. Before, the panel needed to
      be opened for you to adjust the temperature.
  - tweak: Power cells in space A/Cs are no longer removed via menu; if the panel
      is open, you only need to click with an empty hand to remove it, or click with

      carpotoxin, soporific, and phoron.
  - rscadd: Dextrotoxin briefly makes it hard to walk straight before paralyzing you.
      People under the effects of dextrotoxin cannot move or use the radio, but can
      still speak.

  MattAtlas, MoondancerPony, Geeves:
  - experiment: An entirely new medical system! Holy balls that's a lot of changes.

  - tweak: Inaprovaline has been renamed to norepinephrine and viceversa.
  - tweak: CPR has been fixed up a bit. It has a small chance to restart hearts and

  - rscadd: Humans no longer die when hitting 200 damage. Dionae, IPCs, grues and
      zombies are exceptions.
  - rscadd: Humans now die when their brain dies. For the brain to die, it must not
      have oxygen for quite a while.
  - rscadd: Suffocation damage is now a modifier to blood. If you don't have much
      oxygen, then you'll get the effects of low blood.
  - rscadd: Toxins now directly target organs. They'll try to destroy the liver and
      kidneys first... then move onto other organs. Be careful.
  - rscadd: All organs in the body now work towards making sure the brain lives. The
      liver filters toxins, the kidneys do the same, the lungs provide oxygen, the
      heart pumps blood and so on.
  - rscadd: 'Humans now have two new stats: blood oxygenation and blood pressure,
      shown on sensors and scanners. Blood pressure depends on how well your heart
      is pumping your blood. Blood oxygenation depends on how well your blood is oxygenated.'
  - rscadd: Your heart can now stop when your pulse is too high. Your pulse depends
      on many factors - like pain or how much blood your brain wants. A heart in asystole
      cannot pump blood, meaning your brain will suffocate.
  - rscadd: When your heart stops, you go into asystole, aka flatlining. This can
      be fixed with CPR. Make sure that you fix the causes first... or they'll just
      go into asystole again.
  - rscadd: Norepinephrine stabilizes your heartrate. This is a VERY important fact,
      do NOT forget this. Norepinephrine will be your best tool!

      1u antihistamine 1u synaptizine 1u water.

      reagents from the blood.
  - rscadd: New side effects to most healing chems. Be careful.
  - rscadd: Deltamivir now inflicts a fever. Be careful, going overboard with the
      dosage can give you a pretty bad one. Try not to go over 20 units at once.
  - rscadd: Bicaridine now gives you muscle spasms.
  - rscadd: Kelotane makes you drop your held items. Dermaline does the same, as it
      is now a subtype.
  - rscadd: Throwing beakers now shatters them. Be careful.
  - rscdel: Numbers have been deleted from scanners. Mostly. Stop using terms like
      brute and burn damage, boys.
  - rscadd: Taking a good chunk of damage at once now produces adrenaline. Acts like
      a painkiller and raises your pulse. Might also restart your heart.
  - tweak: Soulstones work only when someone's in asystole.
  - tweak: Changed how getting organ damage works. Lasers now deal organ damage.
  - tweak: Most organs can now take more punishment.
  - tweak: The head is now harder to hit.
  - tweak: The organ damage dealt now depends on the size of the organ in the area
      you hit.
  - tweak: Surgery pain is MUCH higher if you're awake.
  - tweak: Self surgery works again.
  - tweak: Using a scalpel on necrotic organs now fixes the necrosis. However, it'll
      also lower the organ's max damage as well.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - bugfix: Circuitry goggles have a sprite again now.

  - rscadd: Added nitrile glove variants for Unathi and Tajara.
  - maptweak: Replaced most instances of latex gloves with nitrile gloves, and made
      xeno variants far more accessible. Latex allergies are no joke, kids.

      instead of white.

2019-12-13:
  Doxxmedearly:
  - tweak: Pets have more discipline regarding food. They will no longer beg for food,
      seek it out, run towards it, steal it, or eat like there's an endless void in
      their stomachs. They'll still eat food on their tile if sufficiently hungry,
      and you can still feed pets by hand, if you'd like. Chefs, rejoice!
  - tweak: Corgi stomach capacity adjusted to a way more sane level.
  - rscdel: Removed guilty messages about pets starving when you examine them; they
      won't go hungry in a single shift, don't worry.
  - rscadd: You can brush most friendly animals. Combs work for fuzzy and feathered
      animals, rags work on other ones.
  - tweak: There's a small chance that when you pet a guard dog (like Columbo) on
      help intent (and aren't his master), he won't immediately maul your face off;
      instead, he will growl at you to warn you not to do that. I still don't recommend
      it.
  - tweak: Like other pets, baby carp can eat now. But not a lot.
  - bugfix: You'll no longer spray yourself with bottles or pepperspray when placing

  - tweak: Windoors are now affected by power loss; non-secure (brig) windoors no
      longer check for access, but must be pushed open. Brig windoors lock shut and
      cannot be moved without power.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Fixes some emotes such as pain dropping items not working.
  Snakebittenn:
  - rscadd: Adds some fishnet underwear options.
  Yonnimer:
  - rscadd: Adds the eternal as a religion choice for Dionae.
  - rscadd: Changes the Dionae blurb to be more up to date.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Footstep animations from vision cones should now remove themselves a bit
      more promptly.
2020-10-27:
  Alberyk:
  - tweak: Spontaneous appendicitis should be rarer now.
  Ferner:
  - rscdel: Removed some unused scarfs in code.
  - tweak: Put winterboots in the loadout under boots, removed duplicate cowboy boots
      selection as these were already present under boot selection.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: If there are new polls, the poll button will now be highlighted.
  - tweak: You can no longer open the crew manifest before the game starts.
  NewOriginalSchwann:
  - tweak: Changes Deep Frontier (DFR) to Non-Coalition Frontier (NCF).
2020-10-28:
  Amunak:
  - admin: Admins now have a new secret to turn all light switches on, off or to their
      initial state.
  - backend: The 'area/set_lightswitch' proc can now be passed 'null' to set the area
      lights to initial state.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Examining trolleys and engines will now tell you whether they're being
      towed, or towing something, and what exactly those are.
  - rscadd: Mapped in various airlocks with one-way exits, meaning that you don't
      need access to exit if you come from that direction. This is primarily to let
      people out of departments without escorts.
  - rscadd: Added the option to put one-way exits in airlocks via airlock electronics.
  - bugfix: Creating stacks from material recipes will now update their icons to display
      their true fullness, such as making rods out of steel.
  - rscadd: Emitters now track how many shots they've fired, which gets reset when
      they get activated. Examine them while adjacent to them to read the value.
  - rscadd: Science can now print cargo trolley circuitboards, built with 15 power
      coils and 1 capacitor.
  - bugfix: Lobbysitter HUDs now properly update the Ready/Join button when the round
      starts.
  - rscadd: Part replacers now output the contents of closed machines nicely.
  - rscadd: Added dual wielding. Firing a gun while another is in the off-hand will
      fire that one as well, at the cost of lost accuracy. You must be on harm intent
      to do this.
  Hocka:
  - bugfix: Simple mobs revived by lazarus injectors now show their alive description
      text.
  Naelynn:
  - rscadd: Added Uranium Solidification chemmical reaction. Mix 20 units of liquid
      uranium, 5 units of frost oil and 5 units of potassium to create a sheet of
      uranium.
2020-10-30:
  Amunak:
  - bugfix: Fixes hardcoded health checks setting to 100 instead of maxHealth (mainly
      in godmode checks but also pAI).
  - rscadd: Added low level APCs (with just a regular battery), to be used in offices
      and other smaller, less critical areas. This allows long-term power loss to
      be of some consequence. Mapped into the security areas.
  - maptweak: Split upper security (investigations & training) into multiple per-room
      areas as it should be. Added light switches and APCs for those areas.
  - maptweak: The room with stairs to Training is now a part of the Training area,
      not Brig.
  - maptweak: Evidence Storage is now its own area as well.
  - maptweak: 'From security/brig there were two rooms split: the ''control room''
      and ''processing''. Also added APCs.'
  - tweak: Added back the option to toggle lights to most Security areas (basically
      everything but places where prisoners are held).
  - tweak: Added/modified area icons for most of the areas mentioned above for easier
      mapping.
  - rscdel: It is no longer possible to recycle any random crap in the Autolathe.
      It is now limited to 'reasonable' items such as stack materials, shards, tiles,
      reagent containers, power cells, shields and a handful of other things. Complex
      devices, guns, stuff that clearly wouldn't fit or doesn't make much sense to
      recycle (returns almost no useful materials) is no longer possible to recycle.
  - bugfix: It should be no longer possible to 'cheat' in the Autolathe by inserting
      items that give more materials than they cost to make in the Protolathe.
  - bugfix: Fixed a handful of the remaining problematic autolathe recipes / recyclation
      materials to not cost less than they're worth.
  - bugfix: 'Fixed stack material recipes to not create more product matter than they
      consume: metal rods and all floor tiles are now worth about half of their previous
      materials.'
  - bugfix: Fixes minor instatiation issues with hand teleporter and an organ when
      initialized in a non-typical way.
  - refactor: Moved the list of research designs to global level. This allows only
      single initialization of it.
  - backend: Added unit test to check if material costs of all research designs are
      greater than what can be gained from recycling their products.
  - backend: Added unit test to check if material costs of stack recipes are greater
      than what can be gained from recycling their products.
  - bugfix: Borers and other flips of the PASSEMOTES flag will no longer change the
      CANWEAKEN flag.
  Geeves:
  - tweak: Headsets' object sprites have been changed to fit their departmental colours.
  - rscadd: Added blood overlays to simple mobs.
  - rscadd: Dead antagonists now get their last words displayed at round end.
  - tweak: Small animals and nymphs can no longer wriggle out of bags or your hand
      when below 60% HP.
  JohnWildkins:
  - tweak: Rescue Pod and Visitor ghost spawners are now mid-round events, rather
      than a 10% chance to activate on round start.
  - rscadd: Added a new subtype of Rescue Pod, which sends a single burglar to the
      Aurora on non-extended rounds.
  - tweak: Decreased chances of Moderate Infestations, Carp Schools, and Rogue Drone
      events. Increased chances of Radiation Storm, Electrical Storm, and Communication
      Blackout events.
  - tweak: Changed Appendicitis chance to scale off slotted Surgeons, rather than
      medical staff. Rampant Brand Intelligence now scales off of engineers rather
      than janitors.
  - rscdel: Removed powergrid check event from rotation, boosted Electrical Storm
      chance to compensate.
  The Stryker, NiennaB:
  - rscadd: Added circle and horn antennas to the loadout (Xenowear - IPC, antenna
      selection).
  - rscadd: Added ripped jeans under the pants selection in the loadout, as well as
      a colorable jumpsuit in the uniforms tab.
  - rscadd: Added a Himeo engineering and atmos voidsuit that can be made with the
      Himeo voidsuit kit and an existing engineering/atmos voidsuit.
  - tweak: The Himeo suit sprite no longer has side views when dragged.
  - tweak: IPC antennae sprites have been changed to be smaller.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - bugfix: EPMC cap should be now lore appropriate colored.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Power cells now drain to exactly zero when it fails to completely satisfy
      a power demand. This will solve cases where the game thought cells with an extremely
      small amount of power weren't empty. e.g. Out of power robots that could not
      move not being able to use their Power Warning verb.
2020-10-31:
  Amunak:
  - rscadd: Starting message when joining as an AI has been moved to a separate pop-up
      window and expanded. It is now also available as a verb 'AI-Help'. This prevents
      message spam when they start while providing more information to new players.
      It also contains OOC info noting that players should be mindful of not ruining
      fun for others.
  - rscadd: Airlocks hacking UI now shows pretty colors for the values. Also tweaked
      some messages and display of the UI. Most importantly, when power is off the
      message is now simplified to 'all the lights are off'.
  - rscadd: Whether AIs can or cannot bolt airlocks is now determined by new states
      of the 'AI control' wire. It is no longer just 'off' (or cut or emagged) and
      'on'. It can be 'off' (cut), 'red' (emagged), 'orange' (AI can control doors
      but not bolt them) or 'green' (AI can bolt or unbolt the doors). Pulsing the
      control wire toggles between green and orange, cutting and emagging still works
      the same. Some airlocks are 'locked' (can be mapped or changed by subtype; currently
      high security doors do this) and pulsing the control wire does nothing.
  - rscadd: The 'AI control' state of most airlocks defaults to whether the airlock
      is locked (mappers and airlock subtypes can override this). This means that
      most airlocks are by default 'orange', so AIs cannot drop (or raise!) bolts
      on the vast majority of airlocks. The exception are secure airlocks, hatches
      (like on tcommsat) and external airlocks whose bolts can be controlled by the
      AI (in case of external airlocks most are bolted anyway, so AI would have bolt
      control regardless).
  - rscadd: There is now an announcement and a delay of 8 seconds for raising and
      4 seconds for dropping the bolts by AIs (traitor AIs are not affected by this,
      though they can choose to 'fake' it). High security doors have even higher delays
      (10/5) and vault has the highest (12/8). It is also no longer possible to spam
      the message - only one action can be done at a time and AIs must wait for it
      to complete.
  - tweak: Tweaked some AI airlock action messages to facilitate the above changes.
      Additionally the bolt announcement message is now an audible instead of visual.
  - tweak: AIs, when using 'Radio Settings', now see their radio channel keys. They
      are also displayed in 'AI-Help'.
  - bugfix: Door now properly updates icon when it regains power.
  - backend: Moved code that gathers radio channels for AI to a separate proc.
  - admin: Fixes admin check in airlock VueUI. Also allows admins to actually toggle
      stuff like bolts, safeties and electrification. De-admin yourself if you want
      to actually play!
  - refactor: Refactored some of the airlock code, especially stuff regarding displaying
      messages and toggling bolts. Some of it was necessary for these changes, other
      parts I think I just made more readable.
  Ferner:
  - maptweak: The research shuttle can now also be docked at yellow dock.
  Flpfs:
  - tweak: Service cyborgs can now pick up clams and molluscs.
  Geeves:
  - admin: Projectiles hitting mobs will now not display an admin log if both the
      firer and the target has no client connected.
  - rscadd: Autohissssss has been added to the character creation menu, and will now
      perssssisssst roundssss and logoutssss.
  - rscadd: Diona now absorb knowledge along with language when sucking blood, this
      is a user prompt that the suckee must enter, and will probably fail to.
  - rscadd: Diona gestalts can now also sample DNA to learn languages and gain knowledge.
  - rscadd: Diona now inject a medium painkiller when sucking blood, called 'Aphrodite'.
  Hocka:
  - tweak: Airlocks now display messages when crushing people.
  JohnWildkins:
  - rscadd: Vending machines now have a graphical, icon-based item interface based
      in VueUI.
  - tweak: Vending machines now have a search bar.
  - bugfix: Icon lag when using vending machines should no longer exist.
  - tweak: Updated the Aut'akh religion lore blurb.
  Naelynn:
  - rscadd: Allows Vaurca to select generic augment loadout items.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Antagonists hiding inside something (locker, chameleon projection, etc.)
      at round end will now appear properly in the end-of-round antag display text.
2020-11-01:
  Alberyk:
  - tweak: Cyanide pills are no longer named cyanide pills.
  Amunak:
  - admin: Varedit now remembers what was in the 'search' field when you click the
      'refresh' link.
  - admin: 'Tweaked varedit styles ever so slightly: it will now likely use a more
      preferred monospace font. Keys are bold and also monospace.'
  - admin: '''NOFALL'' is now a status flag instead of being a var specific to BSTechs.
      It allows the mob to move between Z-levels and through empty space; even to
      ''fly up'' against gravity. However the tech can no longer use this to ''phase
      into'' matter if there is something above them.'
  - admin: 'For that you want to use Ruin-Everything instead: incorporeal movement
      now has an additional type that''s just like a ninja''s, but it also allows
      you to move between Z-levels.'
  - admin: Adds the anti-gravity verb to the Bluespace Robot preset and starts them
      with 'NOFALL' on.
  - admin: When using 'GODMODE' you will no longer take damage when you fall; instead
      a cool message will be shown and a quiet thump will be played.
  - admin: '''GODMODE'' now protects you from the awful effects of running - you can
      run indefinitely and won''t take damage from it.'
  - admin: BSTechs now have additional vision mode - 'darkvision' for seeing normally
      but without lighting.
  - admin: Some of the more arcane BSTech verbs have been renamed and descriptions
      improved (with some added flavour). Rejuv -> Restore Health. Toggle-Gravity
      -> Toggle-Falling (we now have actual gravity on the station, so let's not confuse
      people). And finally Ruin-Everything -> Toggle Incorporeal Movement - as lovely
      as the name is, it doesn't make much sense. This isn't Kill-Everyone or whatever.
  - refactor: Thanks to the above changes the BST is now self-contained in a single
      file (well except for the robot preset).
  - refactor: To facilitate the above changes several godmode and incorporeal checks
      have been added (mostly to movement procs). It cuts on some extra proc overrides
      and type checks. Also results in a more 'natural' experience when using NOFALL,
      GODMODE or incorporeal movement.
  - refactor: Changed incorporeal values to defines.
  - admin: Admins can now override a Respawn verb failure for themselves without calling
      Allow-Player-To-Respawn first.
  Ferner:
  - bugfix: The bridge research shuttle control console will now work again.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Added a GPS to the janitorial closets.
  - rscadd: Janitor belts now hold 8 items instead of 6.
  - rscadd: Mapped in some basic materials for janitors. These materials are for simple
      window and table repairs, as per the janitor wiki page.
  - rscadd: Emagging the pest gun now increases its shot capacity to 10.
  - tweak: An emagged pest gun now does 15 burn damage per shot, as well as 30 halloss
      damage. Changed from only doing 60 halloss.
  - rscadd: The wall fungi event now gives GPS coordinates to the place it's growing.
  - rscadd: Wall fungi can now be scraped off by any sharp object, and then grinded
      to access some useful reagents within.
  JohnWildkins:
  - rscadd: Added modular computer versions of PDAs. Programs that were only available
      on PDA were ported where possible/necessary.
  - rscadd: Added ability to select type of PDA (tablet, wristbound, PDA, or none)
      in character select.
  - rscadd: Added charging cables for recharging handheld modular computers. Simply
      use a handheld computer on an APC to begin charging. Also added hotswappable
      batteries, which may be removed and slotted-in without tools.
  - rscadd: Card slots on modular computers can now store items, just as PDAs once
      did.
  - tweak: Power capacity of modular computer batteries increased across the board.
      Standard PDAs should last approximately two-hours (server time).
  - tweak: NTIRC (messenger) now requires a registered ID to be used. NTIRC is set
      to autorun and will attempt to start itself at roundstart, as well as automatically
      register you.
  - tweak: pAI Atmosphere Sensor and pAI Signaller are now open-use programs. Handheld
      PDAs are now universally private devices.
  - tweak: Using an ID on a computer with an occupied card slot will now swap the
      cards, where possible.
  - rscdel: Removed PDAs, cartridges, and all functionality relating to them.
  - bugfix: An event failing to spawn should no longer hell-spawn fifteen copies of
      another event.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - rscadd: Added five new sets of PDA-style sprites, complete with transparency /
      modular program support.

  Geeves, Dronz:
  - rscadd: Added new clothes for unathi, wasteland kilts, straw hats, wasteland goggles,
      standalone hoods.
  - tweak: Roughspun robes are now recolourable. Mogazali attire is no longer recolourable.
  - rscadd: Added footwraps and caligae to the xeno clothes closet.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - bugfix: Fixes Coalition and Sol voidsuits not accepting oxygen tanks.
  - bugfix: Fixes invisible bandanas.
  - bugfix: Adds spam limiters to coinflips, toy swords and ID cards.
2020-11-03:
  Chada:
  - rscadd: Added a mobility tool to the Rescue module, it acts as a speedboost on
      par with a VTEC.
  - tweak: Altered the Rescue and Medical modules hyposprays to reflect the current
      medical better.
  - bugfix: Fixed an oversight that made the Mining drones drill not available on
      round start.
  - bugfix: Fixed all of the Cyborg/Drone jetpacks being broken.
  Greenjoe12345:
  - rscadd: Adds a white cane. Adds this white cane and the already exsisting crutch
      item to the loadout.
  JohnWildkins:
  - bugfix: Fixes players entering cryo or PDAs that were destroyed not being removed
      from available messengers.
  - bugfix: Some subspecies (Zeng-hu IPC, Tajara subspecies) should now move at their
      intended speeds.
  NiennaB, Stryker:
  - tweak: Changed the Unbranded IPC and prosthetics sprites with one by NiennaB.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Charging cables, such as those on PDAs, will now connect properly to the
      APC icon rather than the turf infront of it.
  - bugfix: Beams, such as charging cables, will no longer exist for one tick then
      delete themselves when being engaged from beyond max range.
  - bugfix: You can no longer climb over a railing if the way is blocked on the other
      side (e.g. by a window).
2020-11-04:
  Chevy:
  - bugfix: Swapped the buttoned and unbuttoned obj sprites for the designer red leather
      jacket so that it would use the buttoned sprite while buttoned and the unbuttoned
      sprite while unbuttoned.
  - bugfix: Replaced the Dominian Noble Coat 5 buttoned sprite with an actual buttoned
      sprite instead of it just using the unbuttoned sprite for both.  This is probably
      useless because I don't think it's used for anything, but I saw it while I was
      fixing the other thing and fixed this too.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Holocalls now send holograms of people in the vicinity to whichever pad
      it's connected to, instead of just sending the caller's hologram. You no longer
      have to stand on the holopad to talk. Give it a try.
  Hocka, Happy_Fox:
  - rscadd: Added steel wool which can be ignited with a cell/other flame source to
      briefly light up an area, as well as light other things. Can be obtained via
      autolathe.
  - rscadd: Empty cans can now be turned into jury-rigged shrapnel grenades which
      are made by filling cans with welding fuel, adding a fuse with steel wool and
      lighting it using a flame source. Shorter fuses have a chance to instantly detonate
      and longer fuses can fizzle out prematurely. Large grenade casings can be used
      to increase the amount of shrapnel.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - bugfix: Adds the missing janitor softcaps and bandanas to the loadout.
  - rscadd: Modifies and adds appropriate departmental berets.
  - tweak: Corporate berets have been tweaked to match their respective uniforms more
      closely.

      now.
  - rscdel: Larger golems can no longer wear uniforms.

  Amunak:
  - bugfix: Fixes runtimes on HUD creation related to players joining before SSAtoms
      starts working.

      round.
2020-11-07:
  Amunak:
  - refactor: Refactors worst offenders from the unsorted.dm helpers file to where
      they fit better (atoms.dm, mobs.dm, ...).
  - bugfix: Fixes messages for water tank wrenching/unwrenching - they were flipped
      and gramatically dubious.
  - bugfix: Changed how cargo spawning defines (STOCK_ITEM_*) work in order to fix
      an issue with deep recursion and prevent a runtime from it.
  Flpfs:
  - bugfix: Rescue borgs now have a medical gripper instead of a magnetic one.
  Geeves:
  - tweak: Changing between mobs no longer changes your hotkey toggle status.

      on the floor.
  mikomyazaki:
  - tweak: Security Belts can now contain disruptor pistols of all kinds.
2020-11-09:
  Amunak:
  - tweak: Buckets and sinks now transfer maximum amount per use. Water tanks transfer
      100 by default, extinguisher, lube and fuel tank 30.
  - tweak: Sinks and water/extinguisher/etc tanks now also have new info description
      reminding people that they can change the amount transferred.
  Ferner:
  - bugfix: Fixed the tcfl field beret being invisible.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Research Module Borgs' Access Code Transmission Device will now properly
      lock/unlock robots.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where multi-modes (e.g. Uprising (Rev+Traitor)) would consider
      players multiple times to see if we had enough enemies, although the player
      could not play multiple roles simultaneously. Therefore multi-rounds could be
      considered valid modes when they were not, and rounds would start with too few
      players in one or more roles.
2020-11-10:
  Amunak:
  - admin: Slightly improves varedit by adding the variable type to the display.
  Chevy:
  - rscadd: Added a new cocktail and associated sprite, the Rum and Cola.  Uses the
      existing Cuba Libre recipe of 2 parts rum and 1 part space cola.
  - rscadd: Added a new recipe for the Cuba Libre.  Mix 5 parts Rum and Cola with
      1 part lime juice.
  - tweak: Cuba Libre is now worth .01 more when you ship it via cargo to reflect
      the fact that you have to make it out of another cocktail now.
  Geeves:
  - tweak: Mortaphenyl and oxycomorphine now metabolize three times faster.
  - rscadd: Alkysine can now be used to counteract confused moving chem side effects,
      while oculine can be used to counteract eyeblur chem side effects.
  - tweak: Synaptizine no longer wildly damages all organs, instead having a chance
      each time it metabolizes to damage the liver, which is fine, unless the liver
      has been damaged already, or is taking damage from multiple sources.
  - bugfix: Fixed the maintenance drone ghost spawner.
  - rscadd: Added more info as to why certain ghost spawners are disabled to the ghost
      spawner menu.
  Geeves, Happy Fox:
  - tweak: Vampires with victim awareness enabled will no longer drop their victims
      to the floor.
  - tweak: Stunned people can no longer interact with radios. This means that you

      you to stop sucking blood at the end of the next drain cycle.
  - rscadd: Gaining a vampire power is now displayed a bit nicer in the chat log.
  - rscadd: Vampires now have a UI element on the HUD for how much usable blood they
      have, what their frenzy counter is at, and to suck people.
  - bugfix: Removing vampire status from a player now removes their vampire abilities
      and such.
  - tweak: Vampires now can only suck up until 950 units of usable blood.
  - tweak: Vampire glare now stuns IPCs and cyborgs as well.
  - bugfix: Hulks no longer have funky punctuation.

  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - imageadd: CCIA and FIB agents have cool new ID badges.
  mikomyazaki:

  - bugfix: Maintenance drones can be disposaled again properly.
  Ferner, Valwyn:

  - rscadd: People who latejoin can now be turned into antags as well, provided they
      have the role preference selected, it's a station antag, and amount of antags
      is lower than or equal to the living player count divided by the antag count
      coeff.
  - tweak: Breaking cuffs is now per species, instead of per species per sex. This
      means that female unathi can break cuffs now.
  - tweak: The visitor ghostrole no longer appears as a unique role on the join menu.

  - rscadd: Latejoin menu is now VueUI and more similar to crew manifest - it is divided
      to sections and uses crew manifest colors. It shows a preview of your character.
      It no longer distinguishes active but AFK players.
  - rscadd: Crew Manifest now uses VueUI (the exact same one as the modular computers
      program). This means that crew manifest will no longer indicate AFK players
      as inactive for ghosts and lobby sitters.
  - rscadd: Crew Manifest program can now print the manifest with a button in the
      UI.
  - rscdel: The ID modification program no longer shows the crew manifest or is able

      have been made prettier and more readable with a common color palette for departments.

      forensic technician). This slightly changed the antagonist report generated,
      but now it's especially needed for the latejoin menu sorting to work.
  - bugfix: Leaving the round now actually decreases the job count for a given job,
      freeing up the slot for others. This also fixes wrong people counters in latejoin
      menu. As a result AIs now use different logic to check if they can spawn/latejoin
      and their numbers are also correct.
  - backend: Added SCSS style utilities inspired by Bootstrap for easier UI styling
      with the use of just classes.
  - refactor: Department names are now defines, crew manifest logic has been simplified
      to accommodate this. The 'Heads' section is now called 'Command'.

      Flags can be assigned to each department (like 'this is a supervisor/head of
      this department).'
  - refactor: Moved Vue departmental colors into a separate Sass file, making it available
      to all either as a universal map or as predefined classes for text color (.text-dept-medical)
      and background (.bg-dept-medical).

      signals. When set to all, it stops everything it did before, as well as stationbounds.

      sprint slower now.

      medium to high-value good.

  - bugfix: Did the same for the NT Phys and Psych Jumpsuits as well
  - bugfix: Made it so mischiveous ghosts can&#x27;t unattach googly eyes, which was
      happening because it was a command verb which required no hands. It now checks
      if you&#x27;re dead before giving a damn about what you say.
  RyverStyx:
  - rscadd: Flags and banners for the Free Traverser movement.
  Vrow:
  - rscadd: Added a toggleable verb for Stethoscopes between Manual and Automatic
      usage. Automatic usage means you&#x27;ll use the stethoscope automatically on
      the selected body part when examining someone adjacent to you. Manual means
      the automatic examine doesn&#x27;t happen.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Pilot helmets recieved a resprite, going for a design that has a visor
      attached rather than mounted goggles. The sprite itself was from Baystation
      and was tweaked to have its visor toggleable. There&#x27;s also a repainted
      TCFL variant.
  - rscadd: Adds a new hairstyle for Humans and Tajara. Short Hair Bun 2 and Tajara
      Bun Short.

      anymore.

      - and not to go.
2022-05-23:

      given precedence to firedoors.

  - bugfix: Full auto no longer prevents you from throwing or using weapon safeties.

  - tweak: Changes the Coeus Dionaeh head to the Geras head, which should fix clipping
      issues and missing pixels with hats and cosmetics

  - tweak: Increases dextrotoxin&#x27;s metabolism speed. Parapens should last ~5
      minutes instead of ~8 minutes.

      used to remove the dextrotoxin and end the paralysis early.

  stev/Memescope, Vrow:
  - rscadd: Added back in the Eridani Private Military Corporation uniforms, headwear

2022-05-24:

      the original rendition.
  - balance: The engineer survival box that most antags and a lot of admin or ccia
      ghost spawners start with now has what survival boxes usually get. Main difference
      is that their oxygen tank is upgraded to an expanded capacity variant and the
      glowstick is replaced with a flare. Horizon engineering department members get
      it too now, it is an engineering box after all.
  - rscadd: Ports the emergency forcing tool from Baystation. On Aurora it&#x27;s
      been renamed to the &#x27;rescue axe&#x27; and true to the name, is a hand axe
      used to force your way into situations where a crowbar would not suffice. You
      can find these in fire closets or in the CE/Atmos tech engineering lockers.
  - tweak: The old retro full face gas masks have been swapped for the clear faced
      gas mask variant within fire closets and engineering lockers.
  - tweak: Fireclosets have been buffed overall. They&#x27;ll usually contain a very
      small amount of inflatables totalling to one door, two walls. The EMTs and the
      bridge will have variants that have two doors, three walls. The EMTs also get
      a ladder in their firecloset.
  - tweak: Firesuits can have a few more things in their suit slots. Crowbars of any
      type, the rescue axe, the fire axe and full oxygen tanks.

  Afya:
  - tweak: Changed color of Ya&#x27;ssa in light mode.

  GrayRachnid:

      space.
  - maptweak: The Intrepid has also gone through a little bit of remodeling. There&#x27;s

      will never get used.
  MattAtlas, RyverStyx:
  - rscadd: Added a new accent for mobs in the Srom.
2022-05-31:
  JohnWildkins:

      clients on PDAs can now be opened off-Horizon, but with limited functionality.
  Vrow:
  - rscadd: Added two more reading outputs for damage. The cap for damage readout
      now is Fatal (over 100 damage), in contrast to Severe (over 50 damage).
  - bugfix: Fixed the Burn Severity reading from being hard numbers to the minor/moderate/significant/severe/critical/fatal.

2022-06-01:
  Doxxmedearly:
  - rscadd: Radio communications are now limited by sector distance. The default max
      range is two grids. The centcomm level, ERT staging, and antagonist bases are
      exempt from this.
  - tweak: Ships will now only hear other ships&#x27; communications if they are within
      this range. Get close on the overmap if you want to eavesdrop. Note that away
      ships will still only hear the Ship Frequency, not Horizon comms.
  - bugfix: Away ship roles should no longer get duplicated radio messages, even when
      in comms range of multiple other away ships.
  - tweak: As away shuttles do not have telecomms units, they will no longer receive
      radio broadcasts when departed, if they were previously able to. Intrepid/Mining
      shuttle can still speak DURING the bluespace jump, away ships cannot. Holopads
      are unaffected.
  - maptweak: Added an External Signal Receiver to the Horizon tcomms room. This does
      not need any special setup or connections, and while powered, will allow away
      ships to communicate with their crew who are aboard the Horizon. This has no
      bearing on antagonists, so disabling it won&#x27;t help you there, crafty engineers.
2022-06-02:
  Ben10083:
  - balance: Most KA barrels now cost Uranium instead of Phoron.
  - balance: KA cell costs have been tweaked.
  Doxxmedearly:

  stev/Memescope, Vrow:

      was made by Memescope! This modsuit is restricted to PMCG and can be found in
      the loadout. It can shift between forms like shortsleeved, or just the pants,
      and some others!
2022-06-03:

      are cut.
  - bugfix: Fix windoors turning invisible when power is cut.

      on them, rather than opening instantly.
  - bugfix: Fix colliding with a pulled simple-mob being picked up sending players
      into another player&#x27;s columbo dimension.
  KingOfThePing:

      a limb that has eggs implanted.
  - rscdel: Completely removes the Rainbow and the Psychodelic jumpsuits.

      friendly as well!

  - rscadd: Added a derelict away site, ported from Baystation.
  Doxxmedearly:
  - rscdel: Removes the &#x27;Remove Sticker&#x27; verb for stickers and googly eyes,
      since you can just click them to remove them.

      the kitchen recipes.
  - rscadd: Adds moss to the garden vending machine.

  - tweak: Inhaling phoron with an inhaler is now really bad for you.
  - bugfix: Full auto is no longer a laser beam that never misses.

  - tweak: 'Fully separated CPR into: Full CPR (Compressions + Mouth-to-Mouth), Compressions
      only, and Mouth-to-Mouth only. With an added buff that Mouth-to-Mouth will work
      if you&#x27;ve Lung Rescued someone with collapsed lungs.'
  - rscadd: Reworked the Auto-Compressor into a Stabilizer Harness. The Stabilizer
      Harness now draws power from a cell with a default load of 1k (which means you
      can also bother Science for better cells), and it can be put into rechargers.
  - rscadd: The new Stabilizer Harness now has the same toggleable Emergency Positive
      Pressure system as the IVs! But it can only handle small tanks like Emergency
      ones and use a good mount of power.
  - rscadd: The Stabilizer Harness toggleable Auto-CPR mode now has a chance to Restart
      Asystole/Flat Lined hearts! Although it also has a low chance to crack the ribs
      ONLY IF the patient is Asystole/Flat Lining.

      Now with in-hands, visible battery, and tank pressure indicators!

  - bugfix: Fixed the Body Scanner VueUI damage readouts not being colored.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Add alt versions of the punk shave and punk shave bun that has a more uniform
      fade.

  - bugfix: Fixes the Unathi Th&#x27;akhist wristguards being unequippable by Unathi.
  - bugfix: Removes some old and (long) outdated stuff on the Tips Of The Round. None
      new added. Yet.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The ninja esword no longer has 100 armor piercing for no reason at all.
  - tweak: The ninja esword no longer has a 100 percent guaranteed deflection rate
      on projectiles. It is now closer to 65 percent when shot with a laser rifle.
  - tweak: Energy sword parrying now functions off of the integrated shield power.
      If the shield power falls to below zero, parrying is no longer possible. Energy
      swords have 100 shield power, while the Ninja energy sword has 150. Shield power
      receives three fourths of the damage parried.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Changes the re-admin text to mention a space ship, instead of a station.
  Wickedcybs:
  - tweak: N2O will now be referred to as &#x27;Nitrous Oxide&#x27; in all cases instead

  kermit:
  - rscadd: Red Nightshade induced berserk state now increases your melee damage by
      50%.
  - tweak: Red Nightshade&#x27;s metabolisation speed has been decreased, so the berserk
      state lasts a lot longer. This also prevents all the toxins immediately destroying
      your liver in 30 seconds.
  - rscadd: An examine message makes it obvious when someone is using Nightshade,
      in addition to the jitters already present.
  - rscadd: Adds flavour messages which appear when using Red Nightshhade.
  - tweak: Moves Nightshade&#x27;s cardiotoxicity to OD only. The liver damage will
      still be severe regardless of ODing.
  - tweak: Changes Nightshade&#x27;s recipe to something more sensical and in-line
      with it&#x27;s effects (now 1u Stimm, 1u Synaptizine, 0.1u Phoron).
  - rscadd: Adds Red Nightshade to the Random Toxin Kit uplink purchase, maintenance

      dock location has been renamed to the much more bureaucratic and unimportant
      SCC Sector Liaison Post.
  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Makes an evidence bag variant called &#x27;resealable plastic bag&#x27;
      and adds some to the kitchen and loadout. Now you too, can store your sandwich

  kermit:
  - rscadd: Cerulean slimes have been re-added and are used to create Extract Enhancer
      - all in line with the wiki.
  - rscadd: Sepia slimes have been re-added. They are not used to create cameras anymore
      as the wiki suggests. They instead can be used to open wood/cardboard material
      portals (with water) or leather/hide material portals (with blood) - for use
      resupplying departments or creating fancier golems.
  - rscadd: 'Pyrite slimes have been re-added. They are not used to create paint/crayons
      anymore as the wiki suggests. They instead can be used to transmute various
      chemicals into stronger variants, some examples include: dexalin -&gt; dexalin
      plus; radium -&gt; unstable mutagen, EZ nutrient -&gt; diethylamine.'
  - tweak: Docility Potions have been renamed to Docility Serums. The Advanced Docility
      Potion is now also a lighter pink, complimenting the slime it&#x27;s acquired
      from.
  - rscadd: 'Some extract abilities have been added to various slimes to compliment
      their pre-existing abilities: Green Slimes (silver &amp; carbon -&gt; bluespace
      crystal), Red (sugar -&gt; glycerol; phoron -&gt; nightshade), Pink (water -&gt;
      paxazide), Oil (water -&gt; plastic/glass material portal).'
  - balance: Gelds the slime glomp attack - them pouncing and latching onto prey is
      already strong enough, especially considering &#x27;friends&#x27; of slimes
      may still, on occasion, be glomped by RNG.
  - balance: Some extract abilities don&#x27;t just require 1u of a chemical to activate,
      some now have a larger &#x27;chemical cost&#x27; - mostly reserved for the more
      powerful abilities.
  - tweak: Slime jelly no longer nukes the liver with 100-300 toxins out of nowhere.
      Instead, it deals genetic damage over time, just like slimes actually do.
  - tweak: Now that Slime jelly&#x27;s healing properties can be used safely, it now
      treats both brute and burn damage to the same degree as butazoline and dermaline.
      It also reoxygenates blood.
  listerla:

  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Added a new away site that features a mysteriously empty casino ship.
      It might prove interesting to the dauntless expedition teams of the Horizon
      and others occupying the overmap.
  - rscadd: Added a new away site that features another mysteriously empty vessel.
      Far smaller than the casino, it&#x27;s a space yacht. This was also ported from
      bay.
  - rscadd: Added a hydrogen tank subtype for shuttles as well as a fuel port subtype
      that starts with a hydrogen tank already inserted inside. Others in the spur
      often have to make due without phoron, so this is for thematic reasons.

      in, at the moment
  - rscadd: Ported all the fancy bay carpets.

      now include an Unathi variant for each.
  SleepyGemmy:
  - rscadd: Adds a Music SFX toggle, to stop jukeboxes and areas from playing music.
  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: The power line to the Intrepid&#x27;s SMES runs off of the main grid now,
      rather than a subgrid.
  WickedCybs, Leudoberct:
  - rscadd: Added a new third party, the Kataphract Chapter Ship. Representing the
      Hegemony&#x27;s finest abroad, probably. They&#x27;re out for adventure and
      to prove themselves. Trade for supplies for the long road ahead, quest, act
      with honour.
  - rscadd: The emergency services dock isn&#x27;t just limited to the ERT TCFL shuttle
      anymore. The OX ship, TCFL third party shuttle and Kataphract shuttle should
      be able to dock to it too now. It&#x27;s also been futureproofed and can be
      used by most ships with a south facing airlock.
  - rscadd: Added two SMES subtypes for mappers. One is turned on and has a capacitance
      coil for autostarted solars, the other is a little less beefy SMES for shuttles.
      Should be nice for mappers.
  - tweak: Had to make fuel ports by default spawn with nothing inside. A subtype
      with phoron already inside the hatch was made and should be replacing all the
      fuel ports as of now. This had to be done, as the way it was initalized, hydrogen
      ports would have 2 fuel tanks inside, one phoron one hydrogen.
  - tweak: Moved the hangar landmarks for the OX and TCFL ship as well as the docking
      landmark on the Horizon for south facing ports. It&#x27;s placed below the airlocks
      in all cases to better accomodate ship design, as having it to the side was
      causing issues.
  listerla:
  - tweak: Added a single pixel to the hijab sprite so that you can&#x27;t see the
      floor through it.
  - tweak: All Himean items are now origin-locked.

      and the like, rearranges some things.

      port maintenance.
  Yonnimer:

      that used jargon use Nralakk instead. '
2022-09-13:
  SapphicOverload:
  - rscadd: Adds prescription safety goggles/glasses.
  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: There was some metal foam behind walls that had walls underneath them
      or even space. Fixed it by making sure underplating was under the metal foam.
  Yonnimer:
  - bugfix: Properly changes the name of somethings in the dionae loadout to ensure
      they don&#x27;t cause issues with items in the Unathi loadout.
2022-09-14:
  DreamySkrell:
  - rscadd: Ti&#x27;Rakqi Freighter. Default/unmodified skrell now has random color,
      headtail and facial tuux style.

  - imageadd: Ported new GPS sprites from Tau Ceti Station, including a new medical
      GPS.

  - bugfix: Fixed mobs being unable to hear from inside machines or objects.

  - rscadd: Adds the San Colettish accent tag for humans and appropriate IPCs.
  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: A solars wire on the kataphract ship bugged out and so the ship wasn&#x27;t
      getting power from one of its arrays, that was fixed .
  - tweak: Kataphract ship had its vessel mass increased, APCs upgraded and SMES tweaked
      as I didn&#x27;t account for the power drain, which was making the engine compartment
      lose power mid flight.
2022-09-17:
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: The ghost follow menu should no longer be spammed with 100s of ghost mobs.

      Liason, Consular Officer and Human Resources Assistant, they now show in their
      own section on job selection and the manifest.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Plasma projectiles have been reworked. They now burn blood like lasers
      do and have lower damage, but have much much higher AP.
  - balance: Most combat hardsuits now have armor values equal to the crimson hardsuit,
      which means that they&#x27;re really good at blocking damage now. The hazard
      hardsuit has been buffed to be comparable to heavy armour instead.
  - bugfix: Fixed binocular message spam.
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to use your binoculars while looking down or up.
  Omicega:
  - maptweak: Moves the TEG power wire in the supermatter room so it doesn&#x27;t
      cover an emergency cooling valve indicator.
2022-09-19:
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Adds missing command support entries to the code.

      of being labelled &quot;misc&quot;.

  - bugfix: Fixes representative being allowed to be played as independent.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Long-range holopads can now call each other even if they&#x27;re on the

      call a long range on any deck of it.
  listerla:
  - bugfix: Shifted the left-facing bobcurl one pixel left, to align with the right-facing
      version.

      run with volunteers optional for party events and low-stress relaxation rounds.
  - rscadd: Added missing stargazer icons, specifically for Valley Haley and added
      labels on the sprites so they&#x27;re less confusing.
2022-09-25:
  Ben10083:
  - maptweak: Re-added paint gun to workshop.
  Connorjg1:
  - tweak: 'Changed access on the Kataphract vessel to allow Hopeful&#x27;s to open
      the armory. Additonally added a Hegemony flag to the armory, changed the hammers/satchels
      to hegemony variation, added bins and changed the hanger lights to spotlights..
      Also removes the boxing gloves for lore reasons. Finally those hopeful&#x27;s
      without flash proof voidsuits now have glasses. '
  - bugfix: Fixed an incorrect amount of rods on the Kataphract vessel.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Holding phoron contaminated items no longer hurts you through voidsuits
      or gloves.
  - bugfix: Washing machines can now wash everything and not just clothes.
  - balance: Nerfs combat hardsuits to be on par with heavy armour.
  Omicega:

      third deck.
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Fixes active edges on the &quot;bigderelict&quot;, &quot;hivebot_hub&quot;,
      &quot;racers&quot;, and &quot;first_aurora&quot; away sites.
  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Ported the magshield station from Bay. You might see it pop up every now
      and then as a potential away site. Have fun.
2022-09-27:
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Fixes the cargo shuttle spawning crates in the cockpit.
  listerla:

      locker access on the ship.
2022-09-28:
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Fixes the research director lacking access to the robotics control console.
2022-09-29:
  Omicega:
  - rscadd: Readds the engineering + atmos clothing wardrobes from the Aurora map.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: If venting happened, third parties wouldn&#x27;t be able to use their emergency
      shutters to escape since it inherently has horizon engineering access required,
      which is ideally supposed to make it so non-engineers can&#x27;t open the way
      into vented areas. Was rectified by adding a variant that needs no access to
      open. Every window and door has the proper type of emergency shutter now.
  - rscadd: Defined more areas for the kataphract ship since a lot of what was mapped
      in was pulling double duty for extra rooms. This would lead to some buggy and
      confusing interactions, especially for those far apart.
  - tweak: Lights in the kataship hangar were swapped for spotlights, as intended.
      Still looks the same, it just shines brighter.
  - tweak: Some of the air alarms still had engineering access requirements, which
      was hopefully fixed on a second pass and changed to kata id stuff instead.
  - rscdel: Removed the unused kata trader and quartermaster access types.
  - tweak: The kata ship docking airlock will actually start bolted now.
  - tweak: the kata ship airlock pumps will both cycle now instead of just one working.
  - rscdel: There were catwalks visible on the solars of the kataship when you look
      at the map using dream maker or strongdmm. These didn&#x27;t spawn in the game
      itself as they weren&#x27;t the interior type. Removed those from the map file.
  - tweak: Moved the position of the kata shuttle&#x27;s docking port controller,
      since it was positioned in a way that it would overlay over anything put on
      the table it was originally on.
  - rscadd: Added the missing air alarms and other minor atmos equipment where it
      was missing on the kataphract ship, like the janitorial room or the brig.
  - tweak: Fixes blastdoor orientations on the kata ship bridge and transport shuttle.
  - bugfix: Correctly tags and replaces the interior/exterior airlock buttons for

  - tweak: The central primary hallway was considered a singular area all way from
      the entrance to operations to the giant room with the stargazer. The stargazer
      area in particular is now considered a different area, which will stress out

      own APC now.

2022-11-05:
  MattAtlas (Code), Kyres1 (Sprites, Mapping):
  - rscadd: 'Added a ship to ship combat system! The basic functioning is that each
      ship has at least four entry points that can be targeted. Projectiles enter
      these entrypoints based on the heading of the ship that fired them. Ex: if you
      are facing the starboard of a ship, and you fire to hit the aft, you will miss.'
  - rscadd: The Horizon now has its own guns! They were fitted in the last few port
      calls. The Leviathan (accessible by Engineering &amp; Command) is on the port
      ballast on Deck 2. The Grauwolf, a flak cannon, is fore of Operations. The Longbow,
      a 406mm artillery gun, is port of the Bridge. The Intrepid has been fitted with
      a 40mm rotary gun, the Francisca.
  - rscadd: To target an overmap object with a gun, go to a targeting console (found
      on the Bridge for the Horizon), open the targeting grid and then click an overmap
      object that you can see. You will then lock onto it.
  - rscadd: To load ammunition into a gun, load the respective shell or bundle or
      whatever you might need into the ammunition loader next to the gun.
  - rscadd: The Leviathan has a fairly complex activation sequence! All details can
      be found in the envelope found in its holding bay.
  - rscadd: Certain guns, like the Grauwolf, can be used to destroy some overmap hazards.
  - rscadd: When targeting multi-z maps like the Horizon, you are able to select a
      z-level to filter the entry points.
  - rscadd: Ship ammunition can be very heavy. If it is, it can only be lifted by
      G2s/G1s/Vaurca Breeders/Bulwarks, by a human in a rig or by a mech clamp. Ripleys
      spawn in the Longbow, Francisca and Grauwolf&#x27;s compartments.
  - rscadd: The helm console has four new buttons under the Maneuvers section. The
      two that look like turning arrows will perform an emergency combat dodge which
      moves the ship by one tile to the left or right, a fairly dangerous maneuver
      that throws everyone on the ship around, unless buckled. The second set that
      looks like arrows with a line at the end will instead turn the ship 45 degrees
      to the left or right, useful for turning to face enemy ships to shoot them.
      This is markedly less dangerous and only puts unbuckled people on the floor.
      It&#x27;s also not as loud.
  - tweak: The Mining Shuttle has officially been given the name of SCCV Spark.
  - bugfix: You can no longer see overmap objects through darkness.
  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Shuttles won&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re jumping into bluespace anymore,
      as they were not anyway. It will look like they&#x27;re actually flying through
      space.

      for combat turning (imagine a compass).

  - bugfix: Ship weapon projectiles no longer miss when they enter a ship. Get down

      all have grauwolf flak batteries. The militia ship has a 40mm rotary cannon.
      The civilian station has a large amount of ammunition to sell.
  - balance: Some third party ships and away sites have had their small arms to be
      more substantial. The civilian station now has an autolathe.
  WickedCybs:
  - backend: Organizes all the away site and ship files. They each have their own
      folders. The generic folder was renamed to awaysite.
  - backend: Seperates the wildcard and corporate ship file as it was being shared
      by the tramp freighter + milita and the ox ship and ee ship respectively.
