changes:
  - rscadd: "End of round summary will now show antagonists as 'apprehended' if they end the round in brig or in cuffs (in 'regular' areas like station, centcom or shuttle) instead of 'fled the station'."
  - backend: "Added two area flags: PRISON and NO_CREW_EXPECTED. The former marks prison areas while the latter marks areas where crew is never present unless for extraordinary circumstances. They are used to detect brigged people and antag status at end of round."
