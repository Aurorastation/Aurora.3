changes:
  - tweak: "Reworks how syringes figure out if they're blocked or looking for injection ports. It now checks for any piece of clothing that covers that specific bodypart."
  - rscadd: "Spacesuit helmets now have injection ports too."
  - tweak: "Made the species injection modifier stack with the clothing modifier, meaning a vaurca wearing a voidsuit will take much longer to inject."
  - bugfix: "Fixed timers for syringe injection through in injection port increasing exponentially."
