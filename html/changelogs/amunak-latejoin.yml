changes:
  - rscadd: "Latejoin menu is now more similar to crew manifest - it is divided to sections and heads are on top."
  - bugfix: "All departmental jobs now have a department assigned (intern jobs and forensic technician). This slightly changed the antagonist report generated, but now it's especially needed for the latejoin menu sorting to work."
  - refactor: "Department names are now defines, crew manifest logic has been simplified to accommodate this. The 'Heads' section is now called 'Command'."
