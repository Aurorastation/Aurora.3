changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a text output to explosions, they will now state if it's near or far, and from which direction it's coming. Sorry it took so long, deaf people."
  - tweak: "Distant explosions now take pressure into account. Dropping a drill outside the station will no longer play an explosion sound for people inside."
