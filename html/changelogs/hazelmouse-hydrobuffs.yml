# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Hydroponics has been partially remapped, implementing atmospheric equipment for some trays allowing their temperature to be controlled."
  - rscadd: "Hydroponics now has access to cranberry seeds, glowshroom spores, nettle seeds, k'ois spores, and liberty cap spores. Of these, only cranberry seeds are accessible in the public garden."
  - rscadd: "Hydroponics now contains a secure and sealed chamber for growing hazardous specimens. You probably shouldn't plant your k'ois anywhere but here, and be sure to wear your hazmat suit and face mask! Lethal consequences may lay in malpractice!"
  - rscadd: "A few new items have been added to the biogenerator, including trash bags, medical belts, and latex gloves."
  - rscadd: "Hydroponics now has access to autoinhalers and autoinjectors."
  - refactor: "Prefilled hydroponics-related crates now spawn with all the necessary tools, and the beekeeping and herbalist crates on the Horizon are now filled by code rather than by mapping."
  - refactor: "Refactored code of seed dispensers to avoid duplicated lists. This does mean, entirely inadvertantly, that Xenobotany has clams now."
  - rscadd: "Slightly expanded hydroponics access to immediately adjacent maintenance."
  - bugfix: "Empty first-aid kits are no longer inferior in storage capacity to filled first-aid kits."
