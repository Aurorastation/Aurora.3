# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Pets have more discipline regarding food. They will no longer beg for food, seek it out, run towards it, steal it, or eat like there's an endless void in their stomachs. They'll still eat food on their tile if sufficiently hungry, and you can still feed pets by hand, if you'd like. Chefs, rejoice!"
  - tweak: "Corgi stomach capacity adjusted to a way more sane level."
  - rscdel: "Removed guilty messages about pets starving when you examine them; they won't go hungry in a single shift, don't worry."
  - rscadd: "You can brush most friendly animals. Combs work for fuzzy and feathered animals, rags work on other ones."
  - tweak: "There's a small chance that when you pet a guard dog (like Columbo) on help intent (and aren't his master), he won't immediately maul your face off; instead, he will growl at you to warn you not to do that. I still don't recommend it."
  - tweak: "Like other pets, baby carp can eat now. But not a lot."
