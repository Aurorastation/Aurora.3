changes: 
  - rscadd: "You can now examine C4 planted on walls to see when it detonates, you can also hit it with tools to access its wires."
  - tweak: "C4 is no longer visible from the other side of the wall, instead its true location is where you're standing on the moment you plant it."
  - bugfix: "Planting C4 no longer forces you to touch the wall before the slap it down. It also doesn't play a dropping sound the moment you apply it."
  - tweak: "You now only do the attack animation once you place the C4, instead of before the timer starts."
