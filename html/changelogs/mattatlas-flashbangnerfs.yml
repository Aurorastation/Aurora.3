# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - tweak: "Flashbangs now no longer stun you if you have moderate ear protection (aka a helmet)."
  - tweak: "Flashbangs now damage you quite a bit if they explode while in your hand or in your pockets. Be careful!"
  - tweak: "The BANG message after being stunned by a flashbang is now bigger."
  - tweak: "Grenades now get redder as they're about to explode. The timing is slightly randomized, so don't use it as an exact indicator of when to throw a grenade."
