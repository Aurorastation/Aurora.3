# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Sterile gloves boxes have had their contents adjusted. Instead of 4x latex gloves and 3x nitrile gloves, they have 2x latex gloves and 5x nitrile gloves."
  - rscadd: "Added nitrile glove variants for Unathi and Tajara."
  - maptweak: "Replaced most instances of latex gloves with nitrile gloves, and made xeno variants far more accessible. Latex allergies are no joke, kids."
  - imageadd: "Changed the icon for the sterile gloves box to show a blue glove icon instead of white."
