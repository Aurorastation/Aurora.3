changes: 
  - rscadd: "Most forms of flashes/blinds, especially mounted flashers, now confuse and render organics dizzy after blinding."
  - tweak: "Confusion has been buffed up a bit to make you move in an unintended direction a bit more often."
  - tweak: "Pocket flashes have had their break chance lowered, and unified together and now don't have a ridiculous chance of breaking for manually using them. This mechanic was a problem for too many years, sorry."
