changes:
  - tweak: "Zombie attacks now have armor piercing."
  - bugfix: "The armor piercing Zombie martial art now actually has armor piercing. It does 5 to 10 damage, but pierces through all armor."
  - tweak: "Zombies now only have 70 brain health and the brain is much easier to hit. If you're a survivor, aim for the head!"
  - tweak: "Zombie bite now has some armor piercing. Zombie claws are now far stronger for damage output, however, since they have more AP and damage."
  - rscadd: "Added useful information for zombies in their attack descriptions."
  - tweak: "Martial arts and unarmed attacks can now have armor piercing. Martial arts effects depend on unarmed attack armor piercing."
  - tweak: "Unarmed attack special effects (such as dropping people) now consider the actual damage dealt in the chance calculation."
