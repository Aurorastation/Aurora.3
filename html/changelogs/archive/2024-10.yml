  SimpleMaroon:
  - rscadd: Added Vaurca Attendants, a subspecies of a subspecies (Warriors). Compared
      to Warriors, they're faster, less prone to brute injury but more prone to burns,
      experience more pain than other Vaurcae, have a signature gaster tail, and no
      mandibles, along with a somewhat unique appearance compared to Warriors overall.
      They can also hold normal-sized items instead of small ones with their vestigial
      arms, and they have no bite attack.
  - imageadd: Added unique sprite aspects for the Vaurca Attendant compared to the
      Warrior, including a differently-shaped head and feet.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Vaurca Warrior left hand icon state, which was one pixel too
      far to the side on the north-facing sprite.
  - qol: Changed the name of Vaurca Warriors to Vaurca Myrmidon.
  hazelmouse:
  - rscadd: Remaps the Tau Ceti Armed Forces corvette ghostrole map to fit newer mapping
      standards. Go Biesel!
  - rscadd: Adds a variety of Tau Ceti Armed Forces uniform assets to the codebase,
      including assets for officers and non-combatants, sprited by NobleRow.
  - bugfix: The TCAF jacket is no longer invisible when worn.
