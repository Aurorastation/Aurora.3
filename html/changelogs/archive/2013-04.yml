  - rscadd: 'New Botany additions: Rice and Plastellium. New sheet material: Plastic.'
  - rscadd: Plastellium is refined into plastic by first grinding the produce to get
      plasticide. 20 plasticide + 10 polytrinic acid makes 10 sheets of plastic which
      can be used to make crates, forks, spoons, knives, ashtrays or plastic bags
      from.
  - rscadd: Rice seeds grows into rice stalks that you grind to get rice. 10 Rice
      + 5 Water makes boiled rice, 10 rice + 5 milk makes rice pudding, 10 rice +
      5 universal enzyme (in beaker) makes Sake.
  faux:
  - imageadd: Mixed Wardrobe Closet now has colored shoes and plaid skirts.
  - imageadd: Dress uniforms added to the Captain, RD, and HoP wardrobe closets. A
      uniform jacket has also been added to the Captain's closet. HoS' hat has been
      re-added to their closet. I do not love the CMO and CE enough to give them anything.
  - imageadd: Atheletic closet now has five different swimsuits *for the ladies* in
      them. If you are a guy, be prepared to be yelled at if you run around like a
      moron in one of these. Same goes for ladies who run around in shorts with their
      titties swaying in the space winds.
  - imageadd: A set of dispatcher uniforms will spawn in the security closet. These
      are for playtesting the dispatcher role.
  - imageadd: New suit spawns in the laundry room. It's for geezer's only. You're
      welcome, Book.
  - imageadd: Nurse outfit variant, orderly uniform, and first responder jacket will
      now spawn in the medical wardrobe closet.
  - imageadd: 'A white wedding dress will spawn in the chaplain''s closet. There are
      also several dresses currently only adminspawnable. Admins: Look either under
      "bride" or "dress." The bride one leads to the colored wedding dresses, and
      there are some other kinds of dresses under dress.'
  - tweak: No more luchador masks or boxing gloves or boxing ring. You guys have a
      swimming pool now, dip in and enjoy it.

      meant for prisoner processing.
  - tweak: Added a couple more welding goggles to engineering since you guys liked
      those a lot.
  - imageadd: Flasks spawn behind the bar. Only three. Don't fight over them. I don't
      know how to add them to the bar vending machine otherwise I would have done
      that instead. Detective, you have your own flask in your office, it's underneath
      the cigarettes on your desk.
  - tweak: Added two canes to the medical storage, for people who have leg injuries
      and can't walk good and stuff. I do not want to see doctors pretending to be
      House. These are for patients. Do not make me delete this addition and declare
      you guys not being able to have nice things.
  - tweak: Secondary entance to EVA now directly leads into the medbay hardsuit section.
      Sorry for any inconviences this will cause. The CMO can now fetch the hardsuits
      whenever they want.

      please stop stealing engineer's hardsuits when you guys want to pair up for
      space travel.
  - tweak: Firelocks have been moved around in the main hallways to form really ghetto
      versions of airlocks.

      that was someone else.
  - tweak: Psych office in medbay has been made better looking.
