  - rscadd: The 2/3rd majority rule for crew transfer is back. Before 3 hours, the
      majority is required to pass a vote.
  - rscadd: Transfer vote timeout added as a config option. Default is 2 hours. No
      transfer vote may be called before that time.
  - tweak: Sleeper and body scanner consoles can be walked through once more.
  - tweak: Most hardsuit modules can no longer be utilized inside mechs.

      verbs.
  - tweak: Holders no longer get debug_variables (view variables) verb.
  - tweak: Processor hang alerts now have numbers to showcase severity of the issue.
      The higher the number, the worse the issue.
  - tweak: Revolution no longer auto-recalls the shuttle. Nor is the death of the
      antagonists a valid end condition.
  - tweak: Voting system tweaked. Crew transfer votes are now special, and run on
      their own timers. This means that cancelled votes no longer interfere with them.
  - tweak: A lot of JMP macros added to attack logs.
  - bugfix: Ghosts can no longer drag people into sleepers, cryo chambers, etcetera.
  - bugfix: You can no longer generate infinite plasmacutters with RIGs.

  - bugfix: Janitors can no longer access medical records. Medical records now require
      medical bay equipment access.

      upon reconstruction. Further, you can now insert TCs into them again.
  - bugfix: Cell 1 has its own locker again.
  - rscadd: Integrated the web interface with the game. Players can now create linking
      requests from the web interface, and accept them ingame. This will be used for
      more feature integration between the two later.
  - rscadd: Integrated the syndicate contract database with the game. Players can
      interact with contracts from the web interface (create new ones, post comments,
      report completion, etcetera), and review the contracts from syndicate uplinks.
      This means that antags with access to an uplink can now roleplay with contracts,
      fulfilling missions and so forth.
  - rscadd: Heisters now spawn with contract uplinks, which are effectively syndicate
      uplinks without the telecrystals, for checking up on the contracts database.
