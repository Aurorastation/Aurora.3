  - rscadd: Radio communications are now limited by sector distance. The default max
      range is two grids. The centcomm level, ERT staging, and antagonist bases are
      exempt from this.
  - tweak: Ships will now only hear other ships&#x27; communications if they are within
      this range. Get close on the overmap if you want to eavesdrop. Note that away
      ships will still only hear the Ship Frequency, not Horizon comms.
  - bugfix: Away ship roles should no longer get duplicated radio messages, even when
      in comms range of multiple other away ships.
  - tweak: As away shuttles do not have telecomms units, they will no longer receive
      radio broadcasts when departed, if they were previously able to. Intrepid/Mining
      shuttle can still speak DURING the bluespace jump, away ships cannot. Holopads
      are unaffected.
  - maptweak: Added an External Signal Receiver to the Horizon tcomms room. This does
      not need any special setup or connections, and while powered, will allow away
      ships to communicate with their crew who are aboard the Horizon. This has no
      bearing on antagonists, so disabling it won&#x27;t help you there, crafty engineers.

      back (if it&#x27;s not torn up!), meaning you can place them again easily.
  RyverStyx:
  - tweak: Tweaks Orion Hangar Tech and Miner Uniforms.
  Vrow:
  - rscadd: Added a new high loft jacket, which is selectable in the loadout.
  stev/Memescope, Vrow:
  - rscadd: Added a PMCG modular jumpsuit, or more simply known as a modsuit, which
      was made by Memescope! This modsuit is restricted to PMCG and can be found in
      the loadout. It can shift between forms like shortsleeved, or just the pants,
      and some others!
2022-06-03:

      are cut.

      into another player&#x27;s columbo dimension.

  Doxxmedearly:
  - rscdel: Removes the &#x27;Remove Sticker&#x27; verb for stickers and googly eyes,
      since you can just click them to remove them.

      the kitchen recipes.

  - tweak: Inhaling phoron with an inhaler is now really bad for you.
  - bugfix: Full auto is no longer a laser beam that never misses.

      that they should now be delimbable by laser rifles and similarly-damaging weapons.

  - maptweak: Shrinks the holodeck and tweaks its templates.
  Vrow:
  - tweak: 'Fully separated CPR into: Full CPR (Compressions + Mouth-to-Mouth), Compressions
      only, and Mouth-to-Mouth only. With an added buff that Mouth-to-Mouth will work
      if you&#x27;ve Lung Rescued someone with collapsed lungs.'
  - rscadd: Reworked the Auto-Compressor into a Stabilizer Harness. The Stabilizer
      Harness now draws power from a cell with a default load of 1k (which means you
      can also bother Science for better cells), and it can be put into rechargers.
  - rscadd: The new Stabilizer Harness now has the same toggleable Emergency Positive
      Pressure system as the IVs! But it can only handle small tanks like Emergency
      ones and use a good mount of power.
  - rscadd: The Stabilizer Harness toggleable Auto-CPR mode now has a chance to Restart
      Asystole/Flat Lined hearts! Although it also has a low chance to crack the ribs
      ONLY IF the patient is Asystole/Flat Lining.

      Now with in-hands, visible battery, and tank pressure indicators!

  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Add alt versions of the punk shave and punk shave bun that has a more uniform
      fade.
  - tweak: Touched up the braids and braid alt hairstyle when it came to the profile

      new added. Yet.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The ninja esword no longer has 100 armor piercing for no reason at all.
  - tweak: The ninja esword no longer has a 100 percent guaranteed deflection rate
      on projectiles. It is now closer to 65 percent when shot with a laser rifle.
  - tweak: Energy sword parrying now functions off of the integrated shield power.
      If the shield power falls to below zero, parrying is no longer possible. Energy
      swords have 100 shield power, while the Ninja energy sword has 150. Shield power
      receives three fourths of the damage parried.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Changes the re-admin text to mention a space ship, instead of a station.
  Wickedcybs:
  - tweak: N2O will now be referred to as &#x27;Nitrous Oxide&#x27; in all cases instead

  kermit:
  - rscadd: Red Nightshade induced berserk state now increases your melee damage by
      50%.
  - tweak: Red Nightshade&#x27;s metabolisation speed has been decreased, so the berserk
      state lasts a lot longer. This also prevents all the toxins immediately destroying
      your liver in 30 seconds.
  - rscadd: An examine message makes it obvious when someone is using Nightshade,
      in addition to the jitters already present.
  - rscadd: Adds flavour messages which appear when using Red Nightshhade.
  - tweak: Moves Nightshade&#x27;s cardiotoxicity to OD only. The liver damage will
      still be severe regardless of ODing.
  - tweak: Changes Nightshade&#x27;s recipe to something more sensical and in-line
      with it&#x27;s effects (now 1u Stimm, 1u Synaptizine, 0.1u Phoron).
  - rscadd: Adds Red Nightshade to the Random Toxin Kit uplink purchase, maintenance
      contraband spawn, and xenobotany/L7 vines biohazard random chemicals pool.
  - rscadd: Adds a Box of Berserk Injectors to the Uplink for 2 TC, containing 2 doses
      of Red Nightshade lasting 2.5 minutes each.

      Hephaestus themed jump instead of being generic.
  - tweak: Changes the Heph Miner to be thematic with Hephaestus as an industry.
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Fixes mining shuttle sensors console being inaccessible. Fixes the possibility
      of the operations hangar being vented if the mining shuttle airlock is forced.

      just arms and legs.

      or pockets, etc.
  - bugfix: Attached items (Augments, robot modules, exosuit equipment) will no longer
      embed in mobs if used to attack.

      the above, as well as some special equipment, like changeling armblades.
  - bugfix: The autolathe will (once again) no longer eat robot modules.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Rescue pods now work again. Instead of spawning on the ship, they spawn
      on an asteroid in the sector. Good luck surviving!
  - bugfix: Drop pod doors can now be dismantled for metal. Survival.
  - bugfix: Vampire grapple now works correctly and doesn&#x27;t anchor you in place.

      to be more consistent with the PMCG colors.
  - bugfix: Fixed Security Aviators in-hand sprites being invisible.
2022-06-10:
  Doxxmedearly:
  - tweak: Away ships are no longer shuttle subtypes. The ships will spawn on the
      overmap, there is no need to &#x27;launch to open space&#x27; first, and there
      will not be a &#x27;faint ship activity&#x27; sector. Away ships still have
      their own shuttles.
  - maptweak: Replaced the no longer needed shuttle control consoles with engine control
      consoles in away ship helms, if the ship did not have one in the helm.
  - maptweak: Added a navpoint to all away ships at their external airlocks; if a
      shuttle can fit, it can dock right up against the ship!
  - bugfix: Fixed the generic shuttle landing point for away ships not appearing as
      a valid destination, and renamed them to better describe the landing area.
  - bugfix: Fixed bugs relating to airlocks disappearing or not functioning once one

  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: The Horizon now has a ton of new landmarks outside the ship for any sort
      of shuttlecraft to visit! If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to sneakily pilot the mining
      pod behind the ship or take a trip to the front of the kitchen and wave at the
      occupants, now you can! Third party players may enjoy more landing zones that
      aren&#x27;t just the hangars as well.

  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: The security hazard jacket is now found in the security lockers, instead

  - bugfix: Fixed the IV drip outputting a specific message even though the installed
