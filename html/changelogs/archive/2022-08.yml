      resupplying departments or creating fancier golems.
  - rscadd: 'Pyrite slimes have been re-added. They are not used to create paint/crayons

      paxazide), Oil (water -&gt; plastic/glass material portal).'
  - balance: Gelds the slime glomp attack - them pouncing and latching onto prey is

      may still, on occasion, be glomped by RNG.
  - balance: Some extract abilities don&#x27;t just require 1u of a chemical to activate,
      some now have a larger &#x27;chemical cost&#x27; - mostly reserved for the more
      powerful abilities.
  - tweak: Slime jelly no longer nukes the liver with 100-300 toxins out of nowhere.
      Instead, it deals genetic damage over time, just like slimes actually do.

      treats both brute and burn damage to the same degree as butazoline and dermaline.
