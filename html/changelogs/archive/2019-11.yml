      Pretty colours + differentiating it from the main grid.
  - maptweak: Makes the Tesla Bay APC a supercap critical APC, like the Supermatter
      engine room, and like the Gravity Generator, instead of the basic one with a
      shitty 5000 cap 'heavy-duty' cell.
  - maptweak: Un-fucks the Engineering Storage area designation. Engineering EVA Storage
      and Hard Storage no longer share the exact same area designation, both with

      cell, because they really need it.
  - maptweak: Splits the entire 'Robotics Lab' area into 'Robotics Lab', 'Robotics
      Charging Bay', and 'Cyborgification Bay'. This means three APCs for different
      objects to draw from, rather than having a cell charger, four exosuit chargers,
      two borg chargers, and the rest of the robotics equipment being on a single
      APC with a 5000 cap cell inside it.
  - maptweak: Renames the 'emergency singularity beacon' in Engineering Hard Storage
      to 'emergency tesla beacon', for clarity, and because we don't use a Singularity
      on the Aurora.

      three seconds with a wrench and five seconds with an open hand respectively.

      of the trap's deployment.
