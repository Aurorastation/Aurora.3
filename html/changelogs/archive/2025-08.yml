2025-08-02:
  Batrachophrenoboocosmomachia:
  - code_imp: Updated alarms to use parent 'panel_open' var instead of child 'wiresexposed'
      var.

      area parentage.
  - qol: Refactored Atmos control app to use grid-based UI using new area metadata.

      on area name, deck, and department.
  - bugfix: Removed several manually defined air alarm 'name' fields from map.
  - bugfix: Fixed swapped ops and aux hangar descriptions.

      based on species.
  - bugfix: Koko Reed Juice now only returns drug feedback messages to Unathi.
  CourierBravo:

      walk through them anymore.
  hazelmouse:
  - rscadd: Botany mechanics have been substantially overhauled to hinge much more
      substantially on light and temperature levels to determine the viability of
      a crop. Mushrooms require slightly cooler temperatures, tropical fruit require
      slightly higher temperatures, and so on. Moghresian and Adhomian crops in particular
      will not grow at room temperature at all, and require a botanist to get them
      to their ideal conditions.
  - rscadd: Hydroponics and Xenobotany have been remapped with additional atmospheric
      equipment to match the new mechanical changes.
  - bugfix: Hydroponics trays no longer lack density.

      there is no seed planted inside it.

      and equipment, particularly everything to do with beekeeping, to help elucidate
      their mechanics a little.
  - rscadd: Seed packets now show their ideal ranges of heat and light!
  - rscadd: Heat tolerances for plants are now tighter, down from 20K to 12K of tolerance
      from their ideal heat.
  - rscadd: Growing a plant at a temperature or light outside of its tolerances now
      stunts the harvest, reducing its yield by half for that harvest.
  - rscadd: Due to the inaccessibility of certain crops to the public garden, the
      chef now has a number of alien produce boxes in their kitchen. You should still
      be able to prepare Skrellian, Unathi, or Tajaran meals without a hydroponicist.
  - rscadd: The xenobotanist now spawns with three random seeds inside their laboratory,
      so you don't invariably need to order these from operations at roundstart.

  Hellfirejag:
  - balance: Changed the falcata to give a slight slowdown even when powered, instead
      of unintentionally speeding up the user. Its still less encumbering than heavy
      armor.
  - rscadd: Added missing recipes needed to make a falcata exoskeleton.
