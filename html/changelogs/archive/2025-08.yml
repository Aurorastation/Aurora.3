2025-08-02:
  Batrachophrenoboocosmomachia:

      walk through them anymore.
  hazelmouse:
  - rscadd: Botany mechanics have been substantially overhauled to hinge much more
      substantially on light and temperature levels to determine the viability of
      a crop. Mushrooms require slightly cooler temperatures, tropical fruit require
      slightly higher temperatures, and so on. Moghresian and Adhomian crops in particular
      will not grow at room temperature at all, and require a botanist to get them
      to their ideal conditions.
  - rscadd: Hydroponics and Xenobotany have been remapped with additional atmospheric
      equipment to match the new mechanical changes.

  - rscadd: Heat tolerances for plants are now tighter, down from 20K to 12K of tolerance
      from their ideal heat.

      stunts the harvest, reducing its yield by half for that harvest.
  - rscadd: Due to the inaccessibility of certain crops to the public garden, the
      chef now has a number of alien produce boxes in their kitchen. You should still
      be able to prepare Skrellian, Unathi, or Tajaran meals without a hydroponicist.
  - rscadd: The xenobotanist now spawns with three random seeds inside their laboratory,
      so you don't invariably need to order these from operations at roundstart.
