  - rscadd: Botany mechanics have been substantially overhauled to hinge much more
      substantially on light and temperature levels to determine the viability of
      a crop. Mushrooms require slightly cooler temperatures, tropical fruit require
      slightly higher temperatures, and so on. Moghresian and Adhomian crops in particular
      will not grow at room temperature at all, and require a botanist to get them
      to their ideal conditions.

  - rscadd: Due to the inaccessibility of certain crops to the public garden, the
      chef now has a number of alien produce boxes in their kitchen. You should still
      be able to prepare Skrellian, Unathi, or Tajaran meals without a hydroponicist.
  - rscadd: The xenobotanist now spawns with three random seeds inside their laboratory,
      so you don't invariably need to order these from operations at roundstart.
