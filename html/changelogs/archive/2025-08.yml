2025-08-02:
  Batrachophrenoboocosmomachia:
  - code_imp: Updated alarms to use parent 'panel_open' var instead of child 'wiresexposed'

      area parentage.
  - qol: Refactored Atmos control app to use grid-based UI using new area metadata.

      term given).

      on area name, deck, and department.
  - bugfix: Removed several manually defined air alarm 'name' fields from map.
  - bugfix: Fixed swapped ops and aux hangar descriptions.
  - qol: More area metadata cleanup and more replacements of area.name with area display
      names for clarity.
  Ben10083:
  - rscadd: Adds S'rendmarr and Ma'ta'ke versebooks to Tajaran loadout.
  - qol: S'rendmarr and Ma'ta'ke chaplains now spawn with their respective versebook.

2025-08-03:
  Batrachophrenoboocosmomachia:
  - code_imp: Added support for reagent/mental to return different feedback text strings
      based on species.
  - bugfix: Koko Reed Juice now only returns drug feedback messages to Unathi.
  CourierBravo:
  - bugfix: Added vehiclefiller for the cars in the warehouse submap, so you can't
      walk through them anymore.
  hazelmouse:
  - rscadd: Botany mechanics have been substantially overhauled to hinge much more
      substantially on light and temperature levels to determine the viability of
      a crop. Mushrooms require slightly cooler temperatures, tropical fruit require
      slightly higher temperatures, and so on. Moghresian and Adhomian crops in particular
      will not grow at room temperature at all, and require a botanist to get them
      to their ideal conditions.
  - rscadd: Hydroponics and Xenobotany have been remapped with additional atmospheric
      equipment to match the new mechanical changes.
  - bugfix: Hydroponics trays no longer lack density.
  - bugfix: You can now see the nutrient and water levels of a hydroponics tray when
      there is no seed planted inside it.
  - rscadd: More descriptive examine text has been added to a lot of hydroponics items
      and equipment, particularly everything to do with beekeeping, to help elucidate
      their mechanics a little.
  - rscadd: Seed packets now show their ideal ranges of heat and light!
  - rscadd: Heat tolerances for plants are now tighter, down from 20K to 12K of tolerance
      from their ideal heat.
  - rscadd: Growing a plant at a temperature or light outside of its tolerances now
      stunts the harvest, reducing its yield by half for that harvest.
  - rscadd: Due to the inaccessibility of certain crops to the public garden, the
      chef now has a number of alien produce boxes in their kitchen. You should still
      be able to prepare Skrellian, Unathi, or Tajaran meals without a hydroponicist.
  - rscadd: The xenobotanist now spawns with three random seeds inside their laboratory,
      so you don't invariably need to order these from operations at roundstart.

  - bugfix: Fixes Hardsuit Module Press duplication bug.

  - balance: Added Xenobiology and Xenobotany to the job roles allowed to access the
      Pilot Room.
  - refactor: Added defined ACCESS_* roles for the Spark, Quark, and Canary to make
      them easier to manage in future (only need to update shuttle access rights from
      job access lists).
  - code_imp: Created new prefab APCs and Air Alarms for the different shuttles to
      make it easier to build (no more manually overriding access_req on default objs).
  - bugfix: Loadout laptop hard drives again initialize with default software.
  - qol: Attempt to improve reliability of Atmos Control app gathering ALL air alarms.
  - rscadd: Added 'refresh' button to Atmos Control app as an in-game fallback to
      manually repopulate the list.
  - code_imp: Updated several files related to modular computers and software to use
      dmdocs.
  Hellfirejag:
  - soundadd: Added 'medium', 'heavy', and 'chonk' alternate sounds for hardsuits.
      Many pre-existing hardsuits now use heavier sounds depending on type.
  MattAtlas:
  - rscadd: Ported wall leaning from CM. Click-drag your sprite to a wall to lean
      on it.

  - qol: Reduces volume of most recently added music tracks.
2025-08-05:

2025-08-07:
  Batrachophrenoboocosmomachia:
  - rscadd: Grants Odyssey Storytellers access to 22 different moderator/admin/debug
      commands to make their lives easier.

      to the mechatronic fabricator.
  - rscadd: Added the falcata exoskeleton as a new low-tier 'combat hardsuit' for
      machinists to make.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Wall leaning now properly updates mob density, meaning that you can walk
      through tiles where there are people leaning on walls.
  - bugfix: Medical items like bandages and ATKs can no longer be used on robotic
      limbs.
  - bugfix: Look Up will now follow the user around until they go under a solid tile.
