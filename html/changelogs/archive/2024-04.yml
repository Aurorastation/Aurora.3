      of the name, that sometimes is the same as the config tag, either way this should
      fix some gamemodes from not being votable and thus the system reverting to extended.
  - code_imp: Forgot to remove the original implementation after moving it, this fixes
      it, as that code is already in the other definition.

  - qol: TGUIfied the interface button alerts.
  QuestioningMark:
  - balance: Adjusted changeling bone dart damaged via throwforce force from 5->15
      and added armour penetration 15.
  - rscadd: Adds new nucleosynthesis reaction in INDRA reactor for producing small
      amounts of uranium, borosilicate glass & lead.
  RustingWithYou:

      overlays.
  - rscadd: Ports Baystation click handlers and build mode.
  The Stryker:
  - rscadd: Adds two Konyanger medals for use in events/as admin spawns.
  kermit:
  - qol: Cryotubes apply less stasis at temperatures between 120K and 200K, meaning
      cryotube beaker mixes are more viable.
  - rscadd: 'Cataleptinol (new recipe: 0.5u phoron, 2u alkysine, 1u clonexadone and
      a 5u cryosilicate catalyst) has been reworked from the ground up to be more
      useful and versatile. Cataleptinol will heal brain activity regardless of oxygenation
      - at cryo temperatures, this is with no consequence; outside of cryogenics,
      the benefits come with large consequences which will exacerbate any medical
      conditions.'
  - rscadd: Cryo/Clonexadone both overdose at 5u. This isn't anything to worry about
      when using Cryo/Clonexadone in a cryotube; using these two chemicals outside
      of cryotubes requires much greater care. Added ocular toxicity (eye damage)
      for use by Cryo/Clonexadone's overdose.
  - balance: Significantly nerfs Cryo/Clonexadone's organ healing. It's still there,
      but pharmacist's can improve upon the organ healing - it's also required due
      to metabolisation/stasis changes. Cryo/Clonexadone only heals brain damage above
      the 50% mark.
  - rscadd: Renames Cryosurfactant -> Cryosilicate. The recipe now also uses silicate
      instead of surfactant.
  - rscadd: Pyrosilicate and Cryosilicate respectively superheat or supercool the
      body, making them useful for inducing cryogenic conditions or chemically incinerating
      someone. Leporazine inhibits these functions.
  - rscadd: Adds a chemical effect for blood thinning - essentially an anti-coagzolug
      effect, it makes you bleed faster. Will prevent coagzolug from working. Currently
      used by Cataleptinol, Fluvectionem and Synaptizine.
  - qol: Bicaridine's AB fixing requires a minimum of 30u (you should still use more
      than this - every 0.1u above this is another roll of 'will it fix the AB?')
      instead of a minimum of 50u. Alternatively, you can used bicaridine in a cryotube.
  - rscadd: Kelotane can now be used in a cryotube to fix disfiguration. Red Nightshade
      in cryogenic conditions will restore bone breaks. Peridaxon+Thetamycin combo
      can de-necrose livers/kidneys in cryogenic conditions.
  - rscadd: Overdosing peridaxon results in the developing of benign tumours; benign
      tumours do not spread or cause collateral damage to organs, they simply cause
      pain. Ryetalyn will put a tumour into recession.
  - rscadd: Genetic damage now results in the developing of malignant tumours; malignant
      tumours will eventually spread and cause collateral damage to organs. Symptoms
      will be different depending on the tumour's location. Ryetalyn will put a tumour
      into recession - some ryetalyn pills can be found in the GTR's Medication Cabinet.
  - balance: Limb deformities resulting from genetic damage may occur more often.
  - imageadd: Renames Blood Pack -> IV Bag. Adds 'Cryonics Mixture' and 'Other Mixture'
      IV bag labels.
  - rscadd: Cryocells can be deconstructed or have their components upgraded. Upgrading
      the components increases the effectiveness of the Cryostasis Settings.
  - bugfix: Coolant tanks no longer anti-nuke an environment's atmosphere when destroyed.
  - bugfix: Cryotubes no longer render synthetics unconscious - IPCs can now bathe
      in cryotubes to cool off.
