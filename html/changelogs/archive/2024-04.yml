      management of the backpack, DMdoc, you know the deal.
  - tweak: Reduced simple animal emote sounds to short range.
  - backend: Turned the var that hold those sounds into a lazylist, saving memory

  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime found on mechs.
  - bugfix: Fixed machine processing for ores going in the negatives for alloying.
  - backend: Some more optimizations, DMdocs, turned a var into a global one, some

  - backend: Optimized some procs, ported from Daedalus Dock.
  FluffyGhost, ReadThisNamePlz:
  - backend: Tweaked the sounds to dampen the volume depending on what is present

      will now properly do that.

  FluffyGhost:
  - code_imp: Removed duplicated cameras with ctags, mainly from the old aurora map.
  - code_imp: Added a scanner for camera ctags uniqueness in the CI.
  - bugfix: For some cursed reason the gamemode selection uses the config tag instead
      of the name, that sometimes is the same as the config tag, either way this should
      fix some gamemodes from not being votable and thus the system reverting to extended.
  - code_imp: Forgot to remove the original implementation after moving it, this fixes
      it, as that code is already in the other definition.
  - code_imp: Ports and adapts TG's maplint, not all checks it has are present, this
      is just the first iteration.
  - code_imp: Updated python dependency to 3.11.9.
  - code_imp: Updated bootstrap.

      issues where the default marking would be layered over the alternative ones.
  FluffyGhost:
  - refactor: Implemented SI prefixes (KILO, MEGA, GIGA, TERA etc.).
  - code_imp: Properly split and use prefixes and suffixes, unit test to verify the
      file exists and is not empty, and that the format convention is respected.
  RustingWithYou:

2024-04-14:
  GeneralCamo:
  - refactor: Ported plane masters from Bay.
  - refactor: Ported some Z-Mimic changes/improvements/bugfixes from Nebula/Bay.
  - bugfix: Floor lights no longer render under floor decals.
  MattAtlas:
  - qol: The rules button now directly links to the rules page.
  - qol: TGUIfied the interface button alerts.
  QuestioningMark:
  - balance: Adjusted changeling bone dart damaged via throwforce force from 5->15
      and added armour penetration 15.
  - rscadd: Adds new nucleosynthesis reaction in INDRA reactor for producing small
      amounts of uranium, borosilicate glass & lead.
  RustingWithYou:
  - bugfix: Non-natural exoplanet turfs will no longer generate mineral resources
      overlays.
  - rscadd: Ports Baystation click handlers and build mode.
  The Stryker:
  - rscadd: Adds two Konyanger medals for use in events/as admin spawns.
  kermit:
  - qol: Cryotubes apply less stasis at temperatures between 120K and 200K, meaning
      cryotube beaker mixes are more viable.
  - rscadd: 'Cataleptinol (new recipe: 0.5u phoron, 2u alkysine, 1u clonexadone and
      a 5u cryosilicate catalyst) has been reworked from the ground up to be more
      useful and versatile. Cataleptinol will heal brain activity regardless of oxygenation
      - at cryo temperatures, this is with no consequence; outside of cryogenics,
      the benefits come with large consequences which will exacerbate any medical
      conditions.'
  - rscadd: Cryo/Clonexadone both overdose at 5u. This isn't anything to worry about
      when using Cryo/Clonexadone in a cryotube; using these two chemicals outside
      of cryotubes requires much greater care. Added ocular toxicity (eye damage)
      for use by Cryo/Clonexadone's overdose.
  - balance: Significantly nerfs Cryo/Clonexadone's organ healing. It's still there,
      but pharmacist's can improve upon the organ healing - it's also required due
      to metabolisation/stasis changes. Cryo/Clonexadone only heals brain damage above
      the 50% mark.
  - rscadd: Renames Cryosurfactant -> Cryosilicate. The recipe now also uses silicate
      instead of surfactant.
  - rscadd: Pyrosilicate and Cryosilicate respectively superheat or supercool the
      body, making them useful for inducing cryogenic conditions or chemically incinerating
      someone. Leporazine inhibits these functions.
  - rscadd: Adds a chemical effect for blood thinning - essentially an anti-coagzolug
      effect, it makes you bleed faster. Will prevent coagzolug from working. Currently
      used by Cataleptinol, Fluvectionem and Synaptizine.
  - qol: Bicaridine's AB fixing requires a minimum of 30u (you should still use more
      than this - every 0.1u above this is another roll of 'will it fix the AB?')
      instead of a minimum of 50u. Alternatively, you can used bicaridine in a cryotube.
  - rscadd: Kelotane can now be used in a cryotube to fix disfiguration. Red Nightshade
      in cryogenic conditions will restore bone breaks. Peridaxon+Thetamycin combo
      can de-necrose livers/kidneys in cryogenic conditions.
  - rscadd: Overdosing peridaxon results in the developing of benign tumours; benign
      tumours do not spread or cause collateral damage to organs, they simply cause
      pain. Ryetalyn will put a tumour into recession.
  - rscadd: Genetic damage now results in the developing of malignant tumours; malignant
      tumours will eventually spread and cause collateral damage to organs. Symptoms
      will be different depending on the tumour's location. Ryetalyn will put a tumour
      into recession - some ryetalyn pills can be found in the GTR's Medication Cabinet.
  - balance: Limb deformities resulting from genetic damage may occur more often.
  - imageadd: Renames Blood Pack -> IV Bag. Adds 'Cryonics Mixture' and 'Other Mixture'
      IV bag labels.
  - rscadd: Cryocells can be deconstructed or have their components upgraded. Upgrading
      the components increases the effectiveness of the Cryostasis Settings.
  - bugfix: Coolant tanks no longer anti-nuke an environment's atmosphere when destroyed.
  - bugfix: Cryotubes no longer render synthetics unconscious - IPCs can now bathe
      in cryotubes to cool off.
