  - qol: Slightly reduced the volume of Crusher's meows.
  CourierBravo:
  - balance: Increases ammo count for most commonly seen energy weapons. Laser pistols
      see increases of 2-3 shots, averaging between 10-12 shots, carbines and rifles
      gain 3-5 more rounds, with some skipped due to high ammo counts or powerful
      projectiles. And blasters have had increases of 2-6, depending on the model.
      Anything scoped, recharging, a disruptor, or otherwise unique/odd is kept the
      same for balance.
