  - rscadd: Makes it so the Enviromental testing facility Odyssey map can roll canon
      scenarios.

  ASmallCuteCat:
  - qol: Reduced the damage done by the 'creature' mob that sometimes spawns from
      certain Xenoarchaology finds.
  Comet Blaze, hazelmouse:
  - rscadd: Added a teal dress for Idris Incorporated to the loadout, accessible to
      characters of the appropriate corporation, intended primarily for use by Idris
      service staff.
  - rscadd: Added the new Idris Incorporated dress to the Idris Cruiser ghostrole.
  ElorgRHG:
  - imageadd: Resprited the corporate and department jackets.
  - bugfix: The large Visegrad flags in the loadout are now actually large.
  - balance: Zeng-Hu vinyl gloves are now on par with nitrile gloves.
  Evandorf:
  - bugfix: Makes the open sides of the chainlink fence passable.

  ASmallCuteCat:
  - qol: Slightly reduced the volume of Crusher's meows.
  CourierBravo:
  - balance: Increases ammo count for most commonly seen energy weapons. Laser pistols
      see increases of 2-3 shots, averaging between 10-12 shots, carbines and rifles
      gain 3-5 more rounds, with some skipped due to high ammo counts or powerful
      projectiles. And blasters have had increases of 2-6, depending on the model.
      Anything scoped, recharging, a disruptor, or otherwise unique/odd is kept the
      same for balance.

  ASmallCuteCat:
  - qol: The windows on the Captain's Office are shuttered at game start, protecting
      Chauncey from getting spawnkilled by carp.
  - qol: The Executive Officer's window shutters are now on their own switch. They
      are closed at round start, protecting Ian from getting spawnkilled by carp.
  - qol: Separated the fire alarm from the disposal unit in the bottom-left corner
      of the central ring. Removed the guest pass terminal and newscaster from that
      corner, as there's already a newscaster and a guest pass terminal not too far
      from where they used to be.
  Batrachophreno:
  - qol: Allow for Insulated Gloves to be stored in Tool Belts.
  CourierBravo:
  - refactor: Refactored the Chemistry-Reagents-Food-Drinks mega-file into 14 new
      files for easier maintenance and readability. Food/drinks are divided into either
      general food and drinks or cultural food and drinks. From there, they're divided
      by human groups, then nonhuman species. Also marks several for review or removal
      at a later date for being blatant references or not real drinks.
  - rscdel: Removed Chemistry-Reagents-Food-Drinks.dm
  FlamingLily:
  - rscadd: Added stateless citizenship options to Underhive Diona, Voidtamers, and
      deep space wildborns.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - rscadd: Streamlines card mechanics. Click on others to deal to them, yourself
      to draw. Ctrl-click to draw, Alt-click to shuffle.
  - rscadd: Adds KOTAHI, the shedding type card game fun for the whole family.
  - rscadd: Tweaks throw sound volume.
  - bugfix: Fixes some runtimes with cards.
  - imageadd: New sprites for playing cards.
  hazelmouse:
  - rscadd: Substantially expanded the messages the player receives after using an
      overloader.
  - balance: Overloaders now last less time than before.
  - bugfix: Resolved icon states that were missing in map editing software for several
      random objects and traps.
  - imagedel: Deleted superfluous icons for punji traps.
  - qol: Debuggers no longer produce the sound of someone being punched in the face
      when used.
  - balance: Nanopaste now takes around twice as long to apply to other mobs as before,
      and five times as long as that to apply to yourself. If you want to be repaired
      quickly, find a buddy to apply it for you!
  - balance: Nanopaste can no longer be applied multiple times simultaneously.
  - code_imp: Expanded documentation to nanopaste code.
  - rscadd: Implements a remap of the spawning area for Actors, as part of the Odyssey
      gamemode, to hopefully be more enjoyable and intuitive. Now featuring a big
      table for everyone to get around on to disagree on the gimmick until the Storyteller
      tells you off.
  - rscadd: Adds a generic clothing vendor to CC, available to every off-ship antagonist.
      This permits players to choose from a variety of generic clothing items, in
      addition to allowing them to recolour all recolourable items to their preference.
  - refactor: Shifts many of the unsimulated floors on the CC z-level, but not all
      of them, to dedicated subtypes instead of a single varedited type.
  kermit:
  - rscadd: The Civilian Yacht has been reflavoured to include affluent individuals
      from places besides the Sol Alliance.
  - rscadd: The Civilian Yacht Crew ghostrole allows you to select Skrell and Synthetics,
      in addition to Human.

  ChangeMe:
  - bugfix: Fixed hijab and colorable hijab not equipping upon spawning in.
  FlamingLily:
  - spellcheck: Fixed a typo in the no-tag IPC warning.
  - balance: Reduced the cooling effects of frost oil and snowflake. Frost oil, a
      condiment, no longer damages the consumer (now about -5 celsius). Snowflake
      no longer reduces the user's temperature to NEGATIVE 200 CELSIUS. It still gets
      you cold enough to burn a little though (about -40 celsius).
  Kano:
  - rscadd: Added a Freebooter Ship variation.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - bugfix: Fixes and updates putting people into dna scanners.
  - bugfix: Fixes being unable to order proto-humans from cargo.
