      but can be used in other various means. They have their own dedicated pump,
      connector, and vent.

  - tweak: Pressure tanks can now attach directly to all pipes.
  - maptweak: The Intrepid and Spark now have externally cycled airlocks, and utilize

      Breeze.'
  - rscadd: Added a pouch of wulumunusha cigarettes to the loadout, only selectable
      by Skrell.
  - tweak: Touched up the wulumunusha reagent by giving it a unique flavour description
      and removing the initial effect.
  SleepyGemmy:
  - maptweak: Tweaked the vault to make more efficient use of available space.
  Sparky_hotdog, Alberyk:
  - rscadd: Added dinner plates and dinner bowls, which can be used to serve up food
      in a somewhat more refined manner.

      to clean them with a cloth, or with your tongue, afterwards.
  - rscadd: Added serving plates which work like trays, but can&#x27;t hold as much.
  - tweak: The item which was a serving plate is now a chopping board. Functionally
      this is the same as before.
  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Added an upgrade to changelings that disables their need to breathe in
      order to survive. Useful for those who don&#x27;t intend on getting full space
      adapation.

  JohnWildkins:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue that prevented several ruins from spawning on exoplanets.
  - bugfix: Fixed ruin spawns being partially / wholly deleted by landing zones, causing
      unit test failures and, of course, deleted ruins.
  - backend: Changed the ruin tag system to more appropriately reflect types that
      actually want to be filtered for. Added planetary tags to restrict ruins by
      planet type.
  - backend: The away site testing map now attempts to build one of each exoplanet
      (excluding lore planets) and one of each ruin.
  Sniblet:
  - tweak: Instead of Zoleth and Vetju, Scay and Vedhra are the new Bound donors for
      Horizon biological testing. This means the bugs you buy come in new colors.

  GeneralCamo:
  - rscadd: Flashlights now consume power. They accept device power cells, with the

      no longer be inspected with flashlights.

      to 10 to compensate.
  - bugfix: The health analyzer now has an inactive sprite, as intended.
