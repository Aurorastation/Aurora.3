2023-02-03:
  FluffyGhost:
  - rscadd: The ship sensors now work as a sonar or radar, obscuring the view when
      the first object is pinged, otherwise the things not in range will not be seen.

      which takes a little of time.

  - tweak: The gravity generator now recovers faster after locking on, and the throws
      have been made asynchronous so recharging starts faster.
  - rscadd: Remote controlled exosuits can now be disassembled for repair, just use

      useful for poisoning, causing mycosis, and vaurca respiration, or phoron/kois/black,
      which is useful for bioterrorism.
  - bugfix: This means that you can no longer solve the phoron crisis with k&#x27;ois.
      For now?
  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: Fixed some navpoints on the outside of the Horizon. The upper deck had

      ahelps.
  - tweak: Lowers the prices of a few ling abilities by one. Affects arm blade, blind
      sting, silence sting.
  - tweak: Added that dying in horror form as a changeling is permanent to the ability

      from other baycode servers. It still has its stuff and some changes for the
      Aurora

      involving them that Matt handled.

  Sniblet:
  - bugfix: Phoron works again
  - rscdel: K&#x27;ois contaminated phoron has been recalled until it can be implemented
      in a way that doesn&#x27;t break all phoron

  MattAtlas:
  - rscadd: Cryo now works correctly for offships. If your mob doesn&#x27;t despawn

      mapped in.
  - rscadd: Added origin and culture restrictions for ghost spawners. Currently only
