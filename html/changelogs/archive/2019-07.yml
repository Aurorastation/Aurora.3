      for stabbing, but much heavier and thus strong as the material for a thrown
      weapon.

      preventing Gestalt from regenerating another nymph and wasting energy.

  Alberyk:
  - tweak: Disabled ert during revolution rounds.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: All wieldable weapons are now wielded via the Wield Firearm verb, or wield-firearm

      reduced to 2 for mining vending machine.
  - tweak: Diona limb regeneration is now progress based instead of a 10 minute timer.
      Light contributes low amount to progress, biomass(nutrition) contributes medium
      amount. Radiation contributes big amount. In comparison Diona will regenerate
      within 10 minutes with just light and having no biomass stored beforehand. Diona
      who has decent amount of biomass stored will regenerate within 5 minutes. Consuming
      food like cow while regenerating will take 2 minutes to regenerate limb. Diona
      who is in light, has biomass stored and has radiation emitting at it will take
      1-1.5 minutes to regenerate limb.

      are stored out of maximum. And regeneration process of a limb.

  Skull132:
  - rscadd: All factions now have a unique ID card.

      to the Freelance Journalist job, because the job's system is literal ass and
      I need to wait for another PR before redoing it.
  - tweak: Tweaked the faction selection menu. It now links to the wiki and all.
  - rscdel: Removed faction specific gear, since it's already present in the job system.

  - bugfix: Fixes Heph-miners spawning with the wrong id card and jumpsuit.
  Skull132:
  - tweak: Modified the way the cell charge anomaly works. It no longer uses absurd
      ranges to charge stuff.

      the flip side, it shouldn't lag the server as consistently anymore.
  - tweak: VV might take a bit to generate the VV screen for large entries.
2019-07-26:
  MoondancerPony:
  - rscadd: Makes it so that you can create a makeshift chemistry workstation allowing
      for crushing, chopping, and heating reagents. You can add an analyser to it
      to view the temperature of the reagents.
  - rscadd: Adds a distillery to turn booze into pure(r) ethanol/butanol and a little
      bit of water.
  - rscadd: Adds lean, made from cough syrup, sugar, and space-up. Adds krok juice,
      made from iron and orange juice. Adds several other drugs coded by BurgerBB
      in a previous closed PR.
  - rscadd: Adds cough syrup which prevents coughing from viruses (and spreading viruses
      via coughing) when in your system.
  - rscadd: Adds recipes for aforementioned drugs, some using cough syrup.
  - rscadd: Adds the ability to stop wounds from bleeding using rags.
  - rscadd: Rags can now be cut from cloth sheets using any sharp object.
  - rscadd: Rags soaked in reagents will transfer 75% of their reagents as touching
      and 25% in blood.
  - rscadd: Alcohol gives pain messages if it's in your blood. This only happens if
      injected or if it goes through wounds.
  - rscadd: Certain reagents, like any kind of alcohol, space cleaner, sterilizine,
      honey, and to a very, VERY small extent water, will disinfect wounds when used
      on rags.
  - rscadd: Deflated lungs can be treated, in an emergency, by clicking someone with
      a syringe with the chest targeted and grab intent enabled. Doing so again will
      damage the lungs and reverse the treatment.
  - maptweak: An empty keg has been added to maintenance.
  - rscadd: Mixing bowls can be printed from the autolathe.
  - refactor: Spaceacillin has been refactored into several new chemicals. Cough syrup,
      allergy medicine, antivirals, antibiotics, and paracetamol can do the exact
      same spaceacillin once could.
  - rscadd: Antibiotics (thetamycin) are now available for bacterial infections. They
      have a small chance of causing side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
  - rscadd: Antivirals (deltamivir) have replaced spaceacillin and do mostly the same
      thing, save for bacterial wound infections. They have a small chance of causing
      side effects such as fever, muscle pain, and fatigue.
  - rscadd: Cough syrup, allergy medication, paracetamol, and medicine cups are now
      available in NanoMed vendors.
  - tweak: Some drinks now heal damage as they did before, though at reduced levels.
  - tweak: Paracetamol now reduces fevers.
  - maptweak: Medical's supplies have been reduced to a less-excessive level, making
      chemists less redundant.
  - tweak: Syringes now begin capped. After use, syringes get dirty and can also transfer
      viruses between successive uses (on humans); it's recommended to throw them
      away in the new sharps bins. If they are only used to transfer reagents, they
      can be used indefinitely. Ported from Virgo.
  - maptweak: Medical, Virology, and Xenobiology all have sharps bins for disposal
      of biohazardous glassware.
  - tweak: There are now three hyposprays in the Medical sublevel, which are equivalent
      to syringes prior to this update. They take the same amount of time to inject,
      and have a capacity of 15 units, but are reusable.
  - backend: Accidentally refactored (almost) all storage items to use the starts_with
      var instead of overriding fill(). This should make it a lot less complicated
      to add new storage boxes.
  - imageadd: Modifies sprites for syringes, done by Geeves.
  - rscadd: Adds medicine cups to take medicine by mouth in a dignified manner.
  - tweak: Changes the glycerol recipe. One unit of triglycerides (can be obtained
      from meat) and two units of any pure alcohol will produce three units of glycerol
      and two units of acetone. Sulfuric acid is required as a catalyst.
  - rscadd: Adds a recipe for glucose. Nutriment can be catalysed into glucose by
      adding sulfuric acid.
  - tweak: Rats and other simplemobs can now only chew empty boxes or boxes with food
      in them.

      damage to the chest if you took limb damage. Priority of limbs damage was also
      changed, now it is Legs > arms > head.'
  - rscadd: Added new Malf ability to malfunction gravity generator. Ability makes
      station loose gravity for 3 seconds and push everyone to the groun as if they
      fell on Z level.

  Lady Fowl:
  - tweak: Added a prompt to welder bombing, to prevent accidental bombs.
2019-07-31:
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Allows IPCs to be Eridani PMCs. IPCs in question must be owned, not free.
