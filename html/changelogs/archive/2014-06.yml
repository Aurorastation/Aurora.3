  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Added docking ports for shuttles
  - rscadd: Shuttle airlocks will automatically open and close, preventing people
      from being sucked into space by because someone on another z-level called a
      shuttle
  - rscadd: Some docking ports can also double as airlocks
  - rscadd: Docking ports can be overriden to prevent any automatic action. Shuttles
      will wait for players to open/close doors manually
  - rscadd: Shuttles can be forced launched, which will make them not wait for airlocks
      to be properly closed
