2016-12-24:
  Atlantis:
  - tweak: Setup Supermatter admin button now uses map markers and supports all coolant
      types.
  - rscadd: Floodlight upgrade added. This upgrade doubles robot's light intensity
      (it will be more or less same as actual floodlight), at the cost of higher power
      usage.
  - rscadd: You may now install matter bin into a cyborg in order to boost it's matter
      synth's maximal capacity. Better matter bin adds more capacity
  - tweak: Default capacity of matter synths for engineering module tweaked a little,
      since prices of reinforced walls, etc. increased recently. Steel changed from
      40 to 60 sheets default, plasteel from 10 (Construction default) to 20.
  - rscadd: SMES units now try to balance their inputs and outputs. For outputs this
      means two SMESes powering the same grid will share the load by percentage. For
      inputs, all SMESes inputting from one power network will split the available
      power by percentage.
  - tweak: 'Some minor SMES configuration changes have been made: Atmospherics SMES
      now starts configured to prevent power outages when people forget about it,
      engine SMESes are now configured to input/output at full rate. These are only
      defaults and may be changed ingame as usual.'

      transport and removal of inflatables.

  - rscadd: NanoUI for Supermatter Crystal - AI/Robot only, purely informational
  - rscadd: Converted phoron glass to borosilicate glass, adjusted heat resistances
      accordingly, got rid of copypaste fire code. Fire resistance is now handled
      by variables so completely fireproof windows are possible with varedit.
  - rscadd: Windows take fire damage when heat exceeds 100C regular windows, 750C
      reinforced regular, 2000C borosilicate and 4000C reinforced borosilicate. For
      comparsions, reinforced walls begin taking damage around 6000.
  - rscadd: Expanded gridcheck random event. Affected devices now show error UI and
      may be restarted manually before the event ends. All Z-levels are now affected

      is carried over too, i.e. you can clawn people if you sew a cathand to yourself.
  - rscadd: Limbs that are left in open will rot in ~7 minutes. Use freezers or cryobags
      to stop it. You can still attach them, but you wish you couldn't.
  - rscadd: 'Updated penlights to be more of use in diagnostics, they now show following
      conditions:'

      penetration, and the PTR mostly ignores body armour.
  - tweak: 'Shotgun slugs and Z8/STS damage has been lowered slightly to accomodate
      for their higher penetration. In general ballistics deal less damage but have
      higher penetration than comparable laser weapons. Notable exception: X-Ray lasers
      have had their damage lowered slightly but gain very high armour penetration.'

      damage but ignore armour completely.
  - rscadd: Shields no longer block attacks from directly behind the player.

      rubber bullets), however they are now more effective at blocking melee attacks
