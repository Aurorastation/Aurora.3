  - rscadd: Bloody footprints! Now stepping in the puddle will dirty your shoes/feet
      and make you leave bloody footprints for a bit.
  - rscadd: Blood now dries up after some time. Puddles take ~30 minutes, small things
      5 minutes.
  - bugfix: Untreated wounds now heal. No more toe stubs spamming you with pain messages
      for the rest of the shift.
  - experiment: On the other side, everything is healed slowly. Maximum you cna squeeze
      out of first aid is 0.5 health per tick per organ. Lying down makes it faster
      too, by 1.5x factor.

  - rscadd: Added 'hailer' to security lockers. If used in hand, says "Halt! Security!".

  - rscadd: Added pneumatic cannon and harpoons.
  - experiment: Added embedded projectiles. Bullets and thrown weapons may stick in
      targets. Throwing them by hand won't make them stick, firing them from a cannon
      might. Implant removal surgery will get rid of shrapnel and stuck items.

  Kilakk:
  - rscadd: Added the Xenobiologist job. Has access to the research hallway and to
      xenobiology.

      access on it instead of all of them.
  - rscadd: Cyborgs can preview their icons before choosing.

  - tweak: The xenoarchaeology depth scanner will now tell you what energy field is
      required to safely extract a find.

      http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t;=7847 &lt;-- Please
      put any commentary good or bad, here.
  - tweak: Some maintenance doors within RnD and Medbay have had their accesses changed.
      Maintenance doors in the joint areas (leading to the research shuttle, virology,
      and xenobiology) are now zero access. Which means anyone in those joints can
      enter the maintenance tunnels. This was done to add additional evacuation locations
      during radiation storms. Additional maintenance doors were added to the tunnels
      in these areas to prevent docs and scientists from running about.
  - tweak: Starboard emergency storage isn't gone now, it's simply located in the
      escape wing.
  - experiment: An engineering training room has been added to engineering. This location
      was previously where surgery was located. If you are new to engineering or need
      to brush up on your skills, please use this area for testing.
