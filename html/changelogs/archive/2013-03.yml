  CIB:
  - rscadd: Added internal organs. They're currently all located in the chest. Use
      advanced scanner to detect damage. Use the same surgery as for ruptured lungs
      to fix them.
  Cael Aislinn:
  - soundadd: Set roundstart music to randomly choose between space.ogg and traitor.ogg
      (see <a =href="http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=6972">http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t;=6972</a>)
  - experiment: All RUST components except for TEGs (which generate the power) are
      now obtainable ingame, bored engineers should get hold of them and setup an
      experimental reactor for testing purposes.

  Cael Aislinn:
  - rscadd: Type 1 thermoelectric generators and the associated binary circulators
      are now moveable (wrench to secure/unsecure) and orderable via Quartermaster.
  - wip: code/maps/rust_test.dmm contains an example setup for a functional RUST reactor.
      Maximum output is in the range of 12 to 20MW (12 to 20 million watts).
  - bugfix: Removed double announcement for gridchecks, reduced duration of gridchecks.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: You can now stab people with syringes using the "harm" intent. This destroys
      the syringe and transfers a random percentage of its contents into the target.
      Armor has a 50% chance of blocking the syringe.

  Cael Aislinn:
  - rscadd: "Beekeeping is now possible. Construct an apiary of out wood and embed\
      \ it into a hydroponics tray, then get a queen bee and bottle of BeezEez from\
      \ cargo bay. \n\t\tHives produce honey and honeycomb, but be wary if the bees\
      \ start swarming."

  CIB:
  - rscadd: Cloning now requires you to put slabs of meat into the cloning pod to
      replenish biomass.
  Cael Aislinn:
  - wip: The xenoarchaeology update is here. This includes a major content overhaul
      and a bunch of new features for xenoarchaeology.
  - tweak: Digsites (strange rock deposits) are now much more nuanced and interesting,
      and a huge number of minor (non-artifact) finds have been added.
  - rscadd: Excavation is now a complex process that involves digging into the rock
      to the right depth.
  - rscadd: Chemical analysis is required for safe excavation of the digsites, in
      order to determine how best to extract the finds.
  - bugfix: Anomalous artifacts have been overhauled and many longstanding bugs with
      existing effects have been fixed - the anomaly utiliser should now work <i>much</i>
      more often.
  - rscadd: Numerous new artifact effects have been added and some new artifact types
      can be dug up from the asteroid.
  - rscadd: New tools and equipment have been added, including normal and spaceworthy
      versions of the anomaly suits, excavation tools and other neat gadgets.
  - rscadd: Five books have been written by subject matter experts from around the
      galaxy to help the crew of the Exodus come to grips with this exacting new science
      (over 3000 words of tutorials!).
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Sec HUDs now can see short versions of sec records.on examine. Med HUDs
      do same for medical records, and can set medical status of patient.
  - rscadd: Damage to the head can now cause brain damage.

  Spamcat:
  - rscadd: Figured I should make one of these. Syringestabbing now produces a broken
      syringe complete with fingerprints of attacker and blood of a victim, so dispose
      your evidence carefully. Maximum transfer amount per stab is lowered to 10.
2013-03-15:
  Cael_Aislinn:
  - rscadd: Mapped a compact research base on the mining asteroid, with multiple labs
      and testing rooms. It's reachable through a new (old) shuttle dock that leaves
      from the research wing on the main station.
2013-03-26:
  Spamcat:
  - bugfix: Chemmaster now puts pills in pill bottles (if one is inserted).
  - tweak: Stabbing someone with a syringe now deals 3 damage instead of 7 because
      7 is like, a crowbar punch.
  - bugfix: Lizards can now join mid-round again.
  - rscadd: Chemicals in bloodstream will transfer with blood now, so don't get drunk
      before your blood donation. Viruses and antibodies transfer through blood too.
  - bugfix: Virology is working again.
2013-03-27:
  Asanadas:
  - tweak: The Null Rod has recovered its de-culting ability, for balance reasons.
      Metagaming with it is a big no-no!
  - rscadd: Holy Water as a liquid is able to de-cult. Less effective, but less bloody.
      May be changed over the course of time for balance.
