      speech) to surround mark-up markers for them to be valid. "/this will/ work,"
      "as /will/ this," ":s/and this./" But, "/this will not /work." This enables
      you to use words with underscores in them, and to type type-paths and other
      things in BYOND.
  - bugfix: Mark-up no longer nukes BYOND server addresses.
  - tweak: IPCs now have a very minor chance of getting shocked from feeding on APCs.

      the global default explosion type.
