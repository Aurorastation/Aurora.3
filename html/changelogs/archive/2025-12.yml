      clothing still exists and can still be selected in the loadout or in vendors.
  - balance: Added some very minor brute, bio and electrical protection to high visibility
      clothing.
  - qol: Added a dedicated category in the loadout selection for existing high visibility
      jackets and pants respectively. This change will break current loadouts using
      either jacket or pants, they need to be re-added manually.

      formatting. This PR probably encountered on it for the first time.

      file and their code has been refactored. Duplicate emissive patterns for the
