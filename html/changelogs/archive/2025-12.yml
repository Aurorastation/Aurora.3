  - balance: Added some very minor brute, bio and electrical protection to high visibility
      clothing.
  - qol: Added a dedicated category in the loadout selection for existing high visibility
      jackets and pants respectively. This change will break current loadouts using
      either jacket or pants, they need to be re-added manually.

      formatting. This PR probably encountered on it for the first time.

2025-12-13:
  Hellfirejag:
  - rscadd: Comprehensively reworked interactions between Psionics, Psi-Receivers,
      Mind Blankers, and Mindshields, such that they now all operate on a unified
      'psi-sensitivity' and psi-blocking check. Being psionic makes you more psi-sensitive,
      but so does having a psi-receiver. Having a mindshield or mind blanker makes
      you less psi-sensitive. A variety of mechanics now operate on psi-sensitivity
      or relative sensitivity.
2025-12-15:

  Batrachophrenoboocosmomachia:
  - balance: Dirty bomb cleanable 'greenglow' decal left behind is now actually radioactive
      to make it more persistently hazardous.
  - balance: '''Radioactive waste'' rare Warehouse spawn submap now uses low-radioactivity
      variants for some of its contents and also been given a radioactive gear crate.'
  - balance: Adds increased taste_mult values to radioactive waste, napalm, and nitroglycerin;
      it should be noticeable if your drink is spiked with any of them.
  - balance: Both uranium and radioactive waste reagents will create radioactive pools
      on the floor if spilled (uranium weak, radioactive waste medium/strong).
  - balance: Bombs are now allowed to be planted on any mob type except for carbons.
  - balance: Increases the numbers of assemblies (signalers, igniters, etc.) stocked
      in vending machines.
  - balance: Increases radiation protection values of both Engineering and Atmos voidsuits.
  - rscadd: Adds a radioactive waste chemical canister to the Uplink (5 tc).
  - code_imp: Adds additional variants of greenglow/radioactive decal and radioactive_waste/hazardous
      obj that are more or less radioactive for mapping and ST use.
  - code_imp: Cleans up bomb timer setting code and admin logging.
  - qol: Adds more examine hints to reagent dispensers.
  - qol: Adds more examine hints to bombs.

  FabianK3:
  - qol: Updated airlock behavior on power loss. Airlocks will no longer open when
      they lose power but instead will stay closed or will close if already open.
  - rscadd: Added airlock manual override mechanic. When an airlock is functional
      and unbolted but simply has no power, a manual override can be used to open
      it. Click the unpowered airlock with an empty hand to start the override procedure.
      This process takes around fifteen seconds and will force open the airlock without
      requiring any tool. It's designed for emergency cases when power failed. The
      door will close again after regaining power after the emergency override has
      been used. Secure airlocks do not feature the manual override.
  GeneralCamo:
  - code_imp: Damage ratios now use integers instead of decimals, reducing the impact
      of floating point rounding errors.
  - bugfix: Implants now remain in amputated limbs.
  - rscadd: Amputated external organs now retain their implants and internal organs.
  - code_imp: Embedded objects are now stored in wounds, not in limbs (at least, not
      directly).
  - balance: Larger embedded objects now halt bleeding in wounds.
  - balance: Embedded objects now halt healing in wounds.
  - code_imp: Untangled damage flags and injury type flags.
  - balance: Pinning no longer blocks yanking out items.
  - balance: Generalise the autoheal threshold so wounds don't autoheal when a limb
      has taken either too much overall damage or the mob has taken significant damage.

  TheGreyWolf:
  - bugfix: The close button on text files in the file management program now works

      have generally been nerfed to be from 1x to 0.8x (1x for baselines, 0.9x for
      industrial G2s, 0.8x for industrial G1s). The burn modifier for shells has been
      raised to 1.3x. Slowdown has generally been massively decreased across most
