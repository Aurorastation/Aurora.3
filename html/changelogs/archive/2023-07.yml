      UI.
  - bugfix: Cloaks have their sprites again.
  - maptweak: Provided a path to port thrusters for engineers which circumvents atmospherics.
      Take the hallway near the Tesla.
  - maptweak: Added signs around engineering to help direct lost engineers to the
      propulsion areas.
  - tweak: Engineers have access to the east region of atmospherics, with the large
      O2 and air tanks. Technically, they always had this. This should allow them
      to fix damage to critical air supply pipes if no atmos tech is present. They
      still cannot access the main region of atmospherics.
  DreamySkrell:
  - rscadd: Adds a visual indication of vessel bearing and direction to helm control
      gui.
  - refactor: Rewrites helm control from nanoui to tgui.
  - maptweak: Remaps the third deck cafe to be Idris themed.
  - rscadd: Adds coffee menu sign and syrups (sprites by disappointedButNotSuprised)
      and takeaway cups (sprite by Crumpaloo).
  - refactor: Split random.dm into categorized files.
  GeneralCamo:
  - rscadd: Added two flags based on Ouerea&#x27;s flags to the loadout.
  Leudoberct1:
  - maptweak: Fixed the Intrepid cycling issues.
  Llywelwyn:
  - rscadd: Added a selection of (colourable) pronoun pins to the pins selection in
      the loadout.
  - tweak: Renamed &#x27;pin tag (colorable)&#x27; in the loadout to &#x27;pins selection&#x27;,
      and made it a list. If you were using the name pin before, you may need to reselect
      it.
  - backend: Added a var to accessories to allow some more customisation with colourable
      overlays. Allows deciding if the overlay should apply to the item it&#x27;s
      attached to or not.
  MattAtlas, Butterrobber202:
  - experiment: Psionics have been reworked to use the Technomancer ability system.
      This means that you get physical ability objects in your hand to use (in hand,
      melee, or ranged).
  - rscadd: You can shift click psionic abilities at the top to obtain info about
      them.
  - rscadd: 'Suppressing your psionics is no longer a thing. Your psionics are only
      suppressed if you are stunned through overusing them, and they will automatically
      unsuppress once you recover. Psionic suppression has been introduced instead:
      using it will hide you from Psi-Search.'
  - rscadd: 'Added a psionic point shop, opened by clicking your psionic hub icon.
      This is also usable by non-antags, but they can&#x27;t buy anything: it&#x27;s
      still useful to use it to know what your powers do and how to use them!'
  - rscadd: 'Antagonists get points usable in the psionic point shop. This varies
      per antag: Loners get 8, borer hosts get 3 (increased by borers with Advance
      Psionics).'
  - tweak: Reworked the Psi ranks. The canon ones are Psionically Sensitive (Skrell),
      Psionically Harmonious (exceptional Skrell born with better psionic control),
      Psionic Apex (unknown to everyone, really). There&#x27;s also an admin-only
      non-canon Limitless level.
  - rscadd: Every 30 minutes, psionics will be pinged in their chat about their emotional
      state, which can be one from a selection. A few minutes after, the responses
      will be tallied together and the winning emotion will be broadcasted. Higher
      psionic rank means higher vote value.
  - rscadd: Added a psionic jumpstarter to the antagonist uplink for 19 telecrystals.
      It will boost you to Psionically Harmonious, but with only 8 psi points.
  - rscadd: Added a truckload of new psionic abilities. No, really. They&#x27;re a
      lot.
  - rscadd: Skrell may choose additional psionics to spawn with in their loadout.
  - rscadd: Added mechanical support for the lack of a Zona Bovinae, mainly for vaurcae
      and dionae. In certain cases, a Zona Bovinae may even be removed from someone...

  - bugfix: Fixes spawning with psionics.
  - bugfix: Fixes a error when sanitizing a character that doesnt have psionics.
  ClemTheDuck:

      now choose to layer them OVER headgear as well as the usual over or under hair.
  - tweak: Changed the sprites of the projectile fired from TCFL blaster guns and
      sec disruptors, they should now look like bolts over orbs.

  - tweak: If at least two engineers are present, Horizon&#x27;s holodecks load random
      programs 5 minutes into the round.
  - maptweak: Robotics lift extended to the third deck.
  FluffyGhost:
  - tweak: Optimized the conveyor belts to be (hopefully) more efficient.
