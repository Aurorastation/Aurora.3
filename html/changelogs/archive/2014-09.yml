  - bugfix: Fixes evidence bags and boxes eating each other. Evidence bags now store

  - rscadd: Hoverpods fully supported, currently orderable from cargo. Two slots,
      three cargo, space flight and a working mech for all other intents and purposes.
  - rscadd: Added the Rigged laser and Passenger Compartment equipment. The rigged
      laser is a weapon for working exosuits - just a ordinary laser, but with triple
      the cool down and rather power inefficient. The passenger compartment allows
      other people to board and hitch a ride on the mech - such as in fire rescue
      or for space flight.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Organs can now be removed and transplanted.
  - tweak: Brain surgery is now the same as chest surgery regarding the steps leading
      up to it.
  - tweak: Appendix and kidney now share the groin and removing the first will prevent
      appendicitis.
  - tweak: Lots of backend surgery/organ stuff, see the PR if you need to know.
