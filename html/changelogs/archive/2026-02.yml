  GeneralCamo:
  - rscadd: 'Added turf fires: Flamethrowers, fuel decals, and very hot atmos fires
      will now generate these fires.'
  - balance: Simple Mobs can now take damage from burning.
  - rscadd: The flamethrower now works on liquid fuel (chems) instead of gasses. Several
      reagents now have accelerant values, determining how effective they are in a
      flamethrower.
  - rscadd: Nitrogen Dioxide and Chlorine are now oxidizers.
  - bugfix: ZAS Hotspots (renamed from fires) no longer generate CO2 from nothing.
      They solely use the reaction to do this.
