  GeneralCamo:
  - rscadd: 'Added turf fires: Flamethrowers, fuel decals, and very hot atmos fires
      will now generate these fires.'
  - balance: Simple Mobs can now take damage from burning.
  - rscadd: The flamethrower now works on liquid fuel (chems) instead of gasses. Several
      reagents now have accelerant values, determining how effective they are in a
      flamethrower.
  - rscadd: Nitrogen Dioxide and Chlorine are now oxidizers.
  - bugfix: ZAS Hotspots (renamed from fires) no longer generate CO2 from nothing.
      They solely use the reaction to do this.
2026-02-02:
  GeneralCamo:
  - code_imp: Refactored away /item/device/
  HanSolo1519:
  - rscadd: Adds Sankt Frederick flags and banners, places them in loadout. Sprites
      by The Ill_Fated
  - imageadd: Updated sprites for the Carthusian Sazerac, April Shower, Poussee Cafe,
      Ice Pick, Caruso, and Dewey Cocktail. Sprites by TomixComics.
  Hellfirejag:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Schlorgo test fail.
  - rscadd: Added 2 new traits (which are temporarily in the disabilities tab) related
      to psi-sensitivity.
  - rscadd: Magic powers of all kinds no longer by-default play the generic pickup
      and drop sounds. This includes psionic powers, which are now silent to equip.
  - rscadd: Canonical psionic powers and some antag psi powers are now invisible when
      held.
  - rscadd: Psi-Suppression is now a passively toggled ability which works like a
      stronger mindshield/mindblanker. It no longer requires you hold the power in
      hand.
  - bugfix: Psi-protection sources like Mindshield, Mindblanker, and Psi-Suppression
      no longer play messages when they passively hide you from Psi-Search.
  - rscadd: Assay no longer gives away antag status by telling you outright if someone
      is an antag psychic. It instead gives you hints as to the target's psi-sensitivity
      (which aren't conclusive of antags).
  - rscadd: Overdosing on Wulumunusha now temporarily increases psi-sensitivity until
      the high wears off.
  - rscadd: Psi-receivers are now a Bioaug instead of a mechanical augment.
  - rscadd: Having low psi-sensitivity now interferes with telepathic messages, such
      as from Commune, Emotional Suggestion, and Read Mind. Causing them to become
      distorted similarly to whispers from 2 tiles away.

      the supposed contents.
  - rscadd: The quikpay ui was updated.
