  - tweak: You can now pay vending machines and EFTPOS scanners without removing your
      ID from your PDA or wallet. Clicking on the vending machine with your ID/PDA/wallet/cash

      but allows quicker access to the various rig modules.
  - rscadd: Silicons with the medical augmentation sensors enabled now also see alive/dead

  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: 'Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the
      bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:'
  - rscadd: Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.
  - rscadd: Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer
      get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.
  - rscadd: Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer.
      They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.
  - rscadd: Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron
      brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely
      demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted
      guys, they will still tase you down.
  - rscadd: Other minor fixes.
  - rscdel: 'The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident
      #1526672. Please don''t let it happen again.'
  - rscadd: The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm,
      plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really)
      bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.
  - tweak: 'Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will
      mercilessly attack them.'
  - rscadd: An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots
      to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We
      still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!
  - rscadd: 'INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and
      anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware,
      we have updated the cryptographic sequencer''s hacking routines as well. The
      medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won''t clean after
      themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works
      on the new farmbots, too.'

  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Adds items to the orderable antag surgical kit so its actually useful for
      surgery.
  - tweak: Adjusts custom loadout costs to be more standardised and balances. Purely
      cosmetic items, shoes, hats, and all things that do not provide a straight advtange
      (sterile mask, or pAI, protection from viruses and possible door hacking or
      records access, respectively), each cost 1 point, items that provide an advantage
      like those just mentioned, or provide armor or storage cost 2 points.
  - rscadd: Adds practice rounds, both .45 for Sec and Detective's guns, also 9mm
      top mounted for the Saber, and for the Bulldog.

      and double barreled shotgun. The firing modes work the same way as the egun;
      click on the weapon with it in your active hand to cycle between modes. Unloading
      these weapons now requires that you click on them with an empty hand.'
