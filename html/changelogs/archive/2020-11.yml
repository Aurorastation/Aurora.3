2020-11-01:
  Alberyk:
  - tweak: Cyanide pills are no longer named cyanide pills.
  Amunak:
  - admin: Varedit now remembers what was in the 'search' field when you click the
      'refresh' link.
  - admin: 'Tweaked varedit styles ever so slightly: it will now likely use a more
      preferred monospace font. Keys are bold and also monospace.'
  - admin: '''NOFALL'' is now a status flag instead of being a var specific to BSTechs.
      It allows the mob to move between Z-levels and through empty space; even to
      ''fly up'' against gravity. However the tech can no longer use this to ''phase
      into'' matter if there is something above them.'
  - admin: 'For that you want to use Ruin-Everything instead: incorporeal movement
      now has an additional type that''s just like a ninja''s, but it also allows
      you to move between Z-levels.'
  - admin: Adds the anti-gravity verb to the Bluespace Robot preset and starts them
      with 'NOFALL' on.
  - admin: When using 'GODMODE' you will no longer take damage when you fall; instead
      a cool message will be shown and a quiet thump will be played.
  - admin: '''GODMODE'' now protects you from the awful effects of running - you can
      run indefinitely and won''t take damage from it.'
  - admin: BSTechs now have additional vision mode - 'darkvision' for seeing normally
      but without lighting.
  - admin: Some of the more arcane BSTech verbs have been renamed and descriptions
      improved (with some added flavour). Rejuv -> Restore Health. Toggle-Gravity
      -> Toggle-Falling (we now have actual gravity on the station, so let's not confuse
      people). And finally Ruin-Everything -> Toggle Incorporeal Movement - as lovely
      as the name is, it doesn't make much sense. This isn't Kill-Everyone or whatever.
  - refactor: Thanks to the above changes the BST is now self-contained in a single
      file (well except for the robot preset).
  - refactor: To facilitate the above changes several godmode and incorporeal checks
      have been added (mostly to movement procs). It cuts on some extra proc overrides
      and type checks. Also results in a more 'natural' experience when using NOFALL,
      GODMODE or incorporeal movement.
  - refactor: Changed incorporeal values to defines.
  - admin: Admins can now override a Respawn verb failure for themselves without calling
      Allow-Player-To-Respawn first.
  Ferner:
  - bugfix: The bridge research shuttle control console will now work again.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Added a GPS to the janitorial closets.

      window and table repairs, as per the janitor wiki page.
  - rscadd: Emagging the pest gun now increases its shot capacity to 10.
  - tweak: An emagged pest gun now does 15 burn damage per shot, as well as 30 halloss
      damage. Changed from only doing 60 halloss.
  - rscadd: The wall fungi event now gives GPS coordinates to the place it's growing.
  - rscadd: Wall fungi can now be scraped off by any sharp object, and then grinded
      to access some useful reagents within.
  JohnWildkins:
  - rscadd: Added modular computer versions of PDAs. Programs that were only available
      on PDA were ported where possible/necessary.
  - rscadd: Added ability to select type of PDA (tablet, wristbound, PDA, or none)
      in character select.
  - rscadd: Added charging cables for recharging handheld modular computers. Simply
      use a handheld computer on an APC to begin charging. Also added hotswappable
      batteries, which may be removed and slotted-in without tools.
  - rscadd: Card slots on modular computers can now store items, just as PDAs once
      did.
  - tweak: Power capacity of modular computer batteries increased across the board.
      Standard PDAs should last approximately two-hours (server time).
  - tweak: NTIRC (messenger) now requires a registered ID to be used. NTIRC is set
      to autorun and will attempt to start itself at roundstart, as well as automatically
      register you.
  - tweak: pAI Atmosphere Sensor and pAI Signaller are now open-use programs. Handheld
      PDAs are now universally private devices.
  - tweak: Using an ID on a computer with an occupied card slot will now swap the
      cards, where possible.
  - rscdel: Removed PDAs, cartridges, and all functionality relating to them.
  - bugfix: An event failing to spawn should no longer hell-spawn fifteen copies of
      another event.

      item to the loadout.

  - bugfix: Fixes players entering cryo or PDAs that were destroyed not being removed
      from available messengers.
  - bugfix: Some subspecies (Zeng-hu IPC, Tajara subspecies) should now move at their
      intended speeds.
  NiennaB, Stryker:
  - tweak: Changed the Unbranded IPC and prosthetics sprites with one by NiennaB.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Charging cables, such as those on PDAs, will now connect properly to the
      APC icon rather than the turf infront of it.
  - bugfix: Beams, such as charging cables, will no longer exist for one tick then
      delete themselves when being engaged from beyond max range.
  - bugfix: You can no longer climb over a railing if the way is blocked on the other
      side (e.g. by a window).
2020-11-04:
  Chevy:
  - bugfix: Swapped the buttoned and unbuttoned obj sprites for the designer red leather
      jacket so that it would use the buttoned sprite while buttoned and the unbuttoned
      sprite while unbuttoned.
  - bugfix: Replaced the Dominian Noble Coat 5 buttoned sprite with an actual buttoned
      sprite instead of it just using the unbuttoned sprite for both.  This is probably
      useless because I don't think it's used for anything, but I saw it while I was
      fixing the other thing and fixed this too.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Holocalls now send holograms of people in the vicinity to whichever pad
      it's connected to, instead of just sending the caller's hologram. You no longer
      have to stand on the holopad to talk. Give it a try.
  Hocka, Happy_Fox:
  - rscadd: Added steel wool which can be ignited with a cell/other flame source to
      briefly light up an area, as well as light other things. Can be obtained via
      autolathe.
  - rscadd: Empty cans can now be turned into jury-rigged shrapnel grenades which
      are made by filling cans with welding fuel, adding a fuse with steel wool and
      lighting it using a flame source. Shorter fuses have a chance to instantly detonate
      and longer fuses can fizzle out prematurely. Large grenade casings can be used
      to increase the amount of shrapnel.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - bugfix: Adds the missing janitor softcaps and bandanas to the loadout.
  - rscadd: Modifies and adds appropriate departmental berets.

2020-11-07:
  Amunak:
  - refactor: Refactors worst offenders from the unsorted.dm helpers file to where
      they fit better (atoms.dm, mobs.dm, ...).
  - bugfix: Fixes messages for water tank wrenching/unwrenching - they were flipped
      and gramatically dubious.
  - bugfix: Changed how cargo spawning defines (STOCK_ITEM_*) work in order to fix
      an issue with deep recursion and prevent a runtime from it.
  Flpfs:
  - bugfix: Rescue borgs now have a medical gripper instead of a magnetic one.
  Geeves:
  - tweak: Changing between mobs no longer changes your hotkey toggle status.
  - bugfix: Sending psionic messages now properly puts a full stop at end.
  Hocka:
  - tweak: Noticeboards now try to put paper directly into your hands instead of immediately
      on the floor.
  mikomyazaki:
  - tweak: Security Belts can now contain disruptor pistols of all kinds.
2020-11-09:
  Amunak:
  - tweak: Buckets and sinks now transfer maximum amount per use. Water tanks transfer
      100 by default, extinguisher, lube and fuel tank 30.
  - tweak: Sinks and water/extinguisher/etc tanks now also have new info description
      reminding people that they can change the amount transferred.
  Ferner:
  - bugfix: Fixed the tcfl field beret being invisible.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Research Module Borgs' Access Code Transmission Device will now properly
      lock/unlock robots.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where multi-modes (e.g. Uprising (Rev+Traitor)) would consider
      players multiple times to see if we had enough enemies, although the player
      could not play multiple roles simultaneously. Therefore multi-rounds could be
      considered valid modes when they were not, and rounds would start with too few
      players in one or more roles.
2020-11-10:
  Amunak:
  - admin: Slightly improves varedit by adding the variable type to the display.
  Chevy:
  - rscadd: Added a new cocktail and associated sprite, the Rum and Cola.  Uses the
      existing Cuba Libre recipe of 2 parts rum and 1 part space cola.
  - rscadd: Added a new recipe for the Cuba Libre.  Mix 5 parts Rum and Cola with
      1 part lime juice.
  - tweak: Cuba Libre is now worth .01 more when you ship it via cargo to reflect
      the fact that you have to make it out of another cocktail now.
  Geeves:
  - tweak: Mortaphenyl and oxycomorphine now metabolize three times faster.
  - rscadd: Alkysine can now be used to counteract confused moving chem side effects,
      while oculine can be used to counteract eyeblur chem side effects.
  - tweak: Synaptizine no longer wildly damages all organs, instead having a chance
      each time it metabolizes to damage the liver, which is fine, unless the liver
      has been damaged already, or is taking damage from multiple sources.
  - bugfix: Fixed the maintenance drone ghost spawner.
  - rscadd: Added more info as to why certain ghost spawners are disabled to the ghost
      spawner menu.

  Geeves:
  - rscadd: People who latejoin can now be turned into antags as well, provided they
      have the role preference selected, it's a station antag, and amount of antags
      is lower than or equal to the living player count divided by the antag count
      coeff.
  - tweak: Breaking cuffs is now per species, instead of per species per sex. This
      means that female unathi can break cuffs now.

      while we tried out this feature!

  - bugfix: The Access Transmission device now works on maintenance drones, too.
2020-11-12:
  Amunak:
  - rscadd: Latejoin menu is now VueUI and more similar to crew manifest - it is divided
      to sections and uses crew manifest colors. It shows a preview of your character.
      It no longer distinguishes active but AFK players.
  - rscadd: Crew Manifest now uses VueUI (the exact same one as the modular computers
      program). This means that crew manifest will no longer indicate AFK players
      as inactive for ghosts and lobby sitters.
  - rscadd: Crew Manifest program can now print the manifest with a button in the
      UI.
  - rscdel: The ID modification program no longer shows the crew manifest or is able
      to print it.

      have been made prettier and more readable with a common color palette for departments.
  - bugfix: All departmental jobs now have a department assigned (intern jobs and
      forensic technician). This slightly changed the antagonist report generated,
      but now it's especially needed for the latejoin menu sorting to work.
  - bugfix: Leaving the round now actually decreases the job count for a given job,
      freeing up the slot for others. This also fixes wrong people counters in latejoin
      menu. As a result AIs now use different logic to check if they can spawn/latejoin
      and their numbers are also correct.
  - backend: Added SCSS style utilities inspired by Bootstrap for easier UI styling
      with the use of just classes.
  - refactor: Department names are now defines, crew manifest logic has been simplified
      to accommodate this. The 'Heads' section is now called 'Command'.
  - refactor: Jobs now store departments as a list so Command is no longer magic.
      Flags can be assigned to each department (like 'this is a supervisor/head of
      this department).'
  - refactor: Moved Vue departmental colors into a separate Sass file, making it available
      to all either as a universal map or as predefined classes for text color (.text-dept-medical)
      and background (.bg-dept-medical).
  Geeves:
  - bugfix: Fixed various holopad bugs, like icon states being wrong.
  - rscadd: Added an examine to holopads to see which pad it's connected with.

      an optimization.

      after being closed.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Added six pack yokes for energy drinks, a storage item for moving a fast
      amount of energy drinks quickly. Currently adminspawn only.
  - rscadd: Radiojammers now also block wireless access to various objects stationbounds
      (AIs, Cyborgs) can access, such as doors, firedoors, and so forth. Being adjacent
      to the object will negate this.
  - rscadd: Non-improvised radiojammers can now be configured to only block stationbound
      signals. When set to all, it stops everything it did before, as well as stationbounds.
  - bugfix: Simple animals such as rats that don't have universal speak or a language
      can no longer be translated by holopads.
  - bugfix: Fixed a verb that caused visible messages (and more) to break.
  - rscadd: Added a small outpost to the engine radiator area.
  - tweak: Gave mining and xenoarch access to the engine radiator airlocks, because
      they keep getting stuck there. Which is hilarious.
  - rscadd: Wizard golems are now given an antag role, which grants them access to
      AOOC.
  JohnWildkins:
  - bugfix: Fixed the Custodial Supplies Locator app not functioning.
  - bugfix: PDAs should no longer display multiple messages when disconnecting their
      charging cables. They also have a gentler message for purposeful disconnecting
      and play a sound when connecting a cable.
  - bugfix: Excessive runtimes should no longer occur from badly-formed beams.
  MattAtlas:
  - backend: Fixes a bunch of runtime errors.
2020-11-15:
  Alberyk:

  - bugfix: Fixed species transformation causing species to get accents that they
      should not be able to select.

  - admin: Admins can now operate APCs (when ghosted).
  - admin: Admins can now operate airlocks with special privileges ONLY when ghosted
      (to prevent accidental admin abuse).
  - refactor: Airlock VueUI should now properly update constantly (including admin
      options).
  Hocka:

      to the user's font size.
  mikomyazaki:
  - rscdel: Maintenance drones no longer have chat clients installed by default.
2020-11-16:
  Amunak:
  - bugfix: Changing someone's rank will no longer cause a runtime that causes Crew
      Manifest to stop working / show nothing.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: The species select in the character creation menu will now display the
      main species first, and then the sub-species after select the main one, instead
      of putting them all in one screen.
  Hocka:
  - bugfix: The engine radiator airlocks no only require one of the listed accesses
      instead of all of them. The radiator shutter button has also received the same
      treatment.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - rscadd: All small mobs fit in the glass jar now.
2020-11-17:
  Alberyk, Coalf, Sleepywolf:

      with 'mov_intent' as the command.

      These macros are 'click_uniform', 'click_belt' and 'click_back' respectively.

  - tweak: Zombies can no longer pick up items. If they somehow pick up a gun, they
      can no longer fire it.
  - tweak: Zombies can no longer operate radios.
  - rscadd: Zombies have gained their own martial art. Three attacks in a row will
      provide an armor piercing bite, whilst their grabs automatically put someone
      into an aggressive grab.
  - tweak: Zombies now take half brute and burn damage. Additionally, they move and
      sprint slower now.
  - tweak: Zombies can now slip. Oh boy.
  - tweak: Zombie bites can now only take trioxin levels up to 30u, where it plateaus.
  - rscadd: Zombies now regenerate broken bones, severed tendons and arteries. If
      they regenerate broken bones, their brute wounds will heal to prevent rebreaks.
      Each heal will cause the next heal to take two seconds longer, starting from
      5 seconds. Only the head is exempt from this healing.
  - tweak: You no longer automatically scream, if you cannot feel pain.
  - tweak: Collapsing no longer gives you a blindness overlay.

      in the Supermatter. Or for making fires.
  - maptweak: Removed the four nitrogen canisters in Engineering Hard Storage with
      four hydrogen canisters. Removes two phoron canisters in toxins with Hydrogen
      canisters.
  JohnWildkins:
  - bugfix: Dionae are selectable in character select once more.
  - bugfix: Chat-input emotes should now function again.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):

      developments.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Clicking on a folded up pAI with an encryption key now slots the key into
