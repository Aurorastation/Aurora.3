      now include an Unathi variant for each.
  SleepyGemmy:
  - rscadd: Adds a Music SFX toggle, to stop jukeboxes and areas from playing music.
  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: The power line to the Intrepid&#x27;s SMES runs off of the main grid now,
      rather than a subgrid.
  WickedCybs, Leudoberct:
  - rscadd: Added a new third party, the Kataphract Chapter Ship. Representing the
      Hegemony&#x27;s finest abroad, probably. They&#x27;re out for adventure and
      to prove themselves. Trade for supplies for the long road ahead, quest, act
      with honour.
  - rscadd: The emergency services dock isn&#x27;t just limited to the ERT TCFL shuttle
      anymore. The OX ship, TCFL third party shuttle and Kataphract shuttle should
      be able to dock to it too now. It&#x27;s also been futureproofed and can be
      used by most ships with a south facing airlock.
  - rscadd: Added two SMES subtypes for mappers. One is turned on and has a capacitance
      coil for autostarted solars, the other is a little less beefy SMES for shuttles.
      Should be nice for mappers.
  - tweak: Had to make fuel ports by default spawn with nothing inside. A subtype
      with phoron already inside the hatch was made and should be replacing all the
      fuel ports as of now. This had to be done, as the way it was initalized, hydrogen
      ports would have 2 fuel tanks inside, one phoron one hydrogen.
  - tweak: Moved the hangar landmarks for the OX and TCFL ship as well as the docking
      landmark on the Horizon for south facing ports. It&#x27;s placed below the airlocks
      in all cases to better accomodate ship design, as having it to the side was
      causing issues.
  listerla:
  - tweak: Added a single pixel to the hijab sprite so that you can&#x27;t see the
      floor through it.
  - tweak: All Himean items are now origin-locked.

      be accessed.
  - tweak: Ti&#x27;Rakqi Freighter. Reshuffles and tweaks the floors, decorations,
      and the like, rearranges some things.

      port maintenance.
  Yonnimer:
  - bugfix: 'Gets the Dionae loadout working, as well as ensure that all items in
      that used jargon use Nralakk instead. '
2022-09-13:
  SapphicOverload:
  - rscadd: Adds prescription safety goggles/glasses.
  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: There was some metal foam behind walls that had walls underneath them
      or even space. Fixed it by making sure underplating was under the metal foam.
  Yonnimer:
  - bugfix: Properly changes the name of somethings in the dionae loadout to ensure
      they don&#x27;t cause issues with items in the Unathi loadout.
2022-09-14:
  DreamySkrell:

      headtail and facial tuux style.

      GPS.

  WickedCybs:
  - bugfix: A solars wire on the kataphract ship bugged out and so the ship wasn&#x27;t
      getting power from one of its arrays, that was fixed .
  - tweak: Kataphract ship had its vessel mass increased, APCs upgraded and SMES tweaked
      as I didn&#x27;t account for the power drain, which was making the engine compartment
      lose power mid flight.
2022-09-17:
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: The ghost follow menu should no longer be spammed with 100s of ghost mobs.

      Liason, Consular Officer and Human Resources Assistant, they now show in their
      own section on job selection and the manifest.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: Plasma projectiles have been reworked. They now burn blood like lasers
      do and have lower damage, but have much much higher AP.
  - balance: Most combat hardsuits now have armor values equal to the crimson hardsuit,
      which means that they&#x27;re really good at blocking damage now. The hazard
      hardsuit has been buffed to be comparable to heavy armour instead.
  - bugfix: Fixed binocular message spam.
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to use your binoculars while looking down or up.
  Omicega:
  - maptweak: Moves the TEG power wire in the supermatter room so it doesn&#x27;t
      cover an emergency cooling valve indicator.
2022-09-19:
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Adds missing command support entries to the code.

  - bugfix: Fixes representative being allowed to be played as independent.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: Long-range holopads can now call each other even if they&#x27;re on the
      same connected Z-levels. That means if they dock at the Horizon they can still

  listerla:
  - bugfix: Shifted the left-facing bobcurl one pixel left, to align with the right-facing
      version.

      labels on the sprites so they&#x27;re less confusing.
2022-09-25:
  Ben10083:
  - maptweak: Re-added paint gun to workshop.
  Connorjg1:
  - tweak: 'Changed access on the Kataphract vessel to allow Hopeful&#x27;s to open
      the armory. Additonally added a Hegemony flag to the armory, changed the hammers/satchels
      to hegemony variation, added bins and changed the hanger lights to spotlights..
      Also removes the boxing gloves for lore reasons. Finally those hopeful&#x27;s
      without flash proof voidsuits now have glasses. '
  - bugfix: Fixed an incorrect amount of rods on the Kataphract vessel.
  MattAtlas:
  - bugfix: Holding phoron contaminated items no longer hurts you through voidsuits
      or gloves.

      third deck.
  SleepyGemmy:

      &quot;racers&quot;, and &quot;first_aurora&quot; away sites.
  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Ported the magshield station from Bay. You might see it pop up every now
      and then as a potential away site. Have fun.
2022-09-27:
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Fixes the cargo shuttle spawning crates in the cockpit.
  listerla:

      locker access on the ship.
2022-09-28:
  SleepyGemmy:
  - bugfix: Fixes the research director lacking access to the robotics control console.
2022-09-29:
  Omicega:
  - rscadd: Readds the engineering + atmos clothing wardrobes from the Aurora map.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: If venting happened, third parties wouldn&#x27;t be able to use their emergency
      shutters to escape since it inherently has horizon engineering access required,
      which is ideally supposed to make it so non-engineers can&#x27;t open the way
      into vented areas. Was rectified by adding a variant that needs no access to
      open. Every window and door has the proper type of emergency shutter now.
  - rscadd: Defined more areas for the kataphract ship since a lot of what was mapped
      in was pulling double duty for extra rooms. This would lead to some buggy and
      confusing interactions, especially for those far apart.
  - tweak: Lights in the kataship hangar were swapped for spotlights, as intended.
      Still looks the same, it just shines brighter.
  - tweak: Some of the air alarms still had engineering access requirements, which
      was hopefully fixed on a second pass and changed to kata id stuff instead.
  - rscdel: Removed the unused kata trader and quartermaster access types.
  - tweak: The kata ship docking airlock will actually start bolted now.
  - tweak: the kata ship airlock pumps will both cycle now instead of just one working.
  - rscdel: There were catwalks visible on the solars of the kataship when you look
      at the map using dream maker or strongdmm. These didn&#x27;t spawn in the game
      itself as they weren&#x27;t the interior type. Removed those from the map file.
  - tweak: Moved the position of the kata shuttle&#x27;s docking port controller,
      since it was positioned in a way that it would overlay over anything put on
      the table it was originally on.
  - rscadd: Added the missing air alarms and other minor atmos equipment where it
      was missing on the kataphract ship, like the janitorial room or the brig.
  - tweak: Fixes blastdoor orientations on the kata ship bridge and transport shuttle.
  - bugfix: Correctly tags and replaces the interior/exterior airlock buttons for
      the yacht so they should actually work now if anyone ever fixes that ship.
  - tweak: The yacht&#x27;s airlock is being fed by an air canister as intended instead
      of an entire air pressure tank.
