  Furrycactus, Doxxmedearly:
  - maptweak: The month of a certain over-commercialised holiday and tacky decorations
      has begun. NanoTrasen has seen fit to leave no public hall, break room, Head
      of Staff (+Quartermaster, how generous) office spared of holiday decor, and
      no Civilian department workspace bare of tacky flashing holiday lights. They
      even put a gaudily decorated tree in the bar, with gifts layed under it every
      shift, and all of the special grass and astroturf on the station has been replaced
      with Authentic(tm) Snow! Show some holiday spirit, and spend money on the newest

  - tweak: Space A/Cs now heat and cool slightly faster.
  - rscadd: Space A/Cs can now be emagged, which increases the range they can heat
      and cool, as well as improving their efficiency. Temperature-sensitive species,
      Tremble!
  - tweak: Interacting with space A/Cs is slightly different. If the panel is closed
      and you click it, it brings up the interface menu, which allows you to turn
      it on and off, as well as adjust the temperature. Before, the panel needed to
      be opened for you to adjust the temperature.
  - tweak: Power cells in space A/Cs are no longer removed via menu; if the panel
      is open, you only need to click with an empty hand to remove it, or click with

  Kaedwuff:
  - rscadd: Added a new chemical, dextrotoxin.  It is made somewhat wastefully with
      carpotoxin, soporific, and phoron.
  - rscadd: Dextrotoxin briefly makes it hard to walk straight before paralyzing you.
      People under the effects of dextrotoxin cannot move or use the radio, but can
      still speak.
  - tweak: Dextrotoxin replaces zombie powder in any antagonist item that previously
      contained it. Zombie powder is still possible to manufacture.

      one.
  MattAtlas, MoondancerPony, Geeves:
  - experiment: An entirely new medical system! Holy balls that's a lot of changes.

      to all your limbs.
  - rscadd: Traumas no longer happen due to oxyloss.
  - tweak: Inaprovaline has been renamed to norepinephrine and viceversa.
  - tweak: CPR has been fixed up a bit. It has a small chance to restart hearts and
      can work with or without mouth-to-mouth.
  - rscadd: Humans no longer die when hitting 200 damage. Dionae, IPCs, grues and
      zombies are exceptions.
  - rscadd: Humans now die when their brain dies. For the brain to die, it must not
      have oxygen for quite a while.
  - rscadd: Suffocation damage is now a modifier to blood. If you don't have much
      oxygen, then you'll get the effects of low blood.
  - rscadd: Toxins now directly target organs. They'll try to destroy the liver and
      kidneys first... then move onto other organs. Be careful.
  - rscadd: All organs in the body now work towards making sure the brain lives. The
      liver filters toxins, the kidneys do the same, the lungs provide oxygen, the
      heart pumps blood and so on.
  - rscadd: 'Humans now have two new stats: blood oxygenation and blood pressure,
      shown on sensors and scanners. Blood pressure depends on how well your heart
      is pumping your blood. Blood oxygenation depends on how well your blood is oxygenated.'
  - rscadd: Your heart can now stop when your pulse is too high. Your pulse depends
      on many factors - like pain or how much blood your brain wants. A heart in asystole
      cannot pump blood, meaning your brain will suffocate.
  - rscadd: When your heart stops, you go into asystole, aka flatlining. This can
      be fixed with CPR. Make sure that you fix the causes first... or they'll just
      go into asystole again.
  - rscadd: Norepinephrine stabilizes your heartrate. This is a VERY important fact,
      do NOT forget this. Norepinephrine will be your best tool!
  - tweak: Tricordazine recipe is now 1u epinephrine 1u dylovene.

      1u dexalinplus.

      1u antihistamine 1u synaptizine 1u water.
  - rscadd: Dexalin and dexalin+ no longer straight up heal oxyloss. Instead, they
      now fool your brain into thinking that it has 50% oxygen and 80% oxygen respectively.
  - rscadd: Alkysine now only heals the brain if it's properly oxygenated.
  - rscadd: Added a stomach organ. This controls reagent ingestion and food ingestion.

      people's stomach.
  - tweak: Peridaxon now heals brain damage, if it's not damaged much at all.

      reagents from the blood.
  - rscadd: New side effects to most healing chems. Be careful.
  - rscadd: Deltamivir now inflicts a fever. Be careful, going overboard with the
      dosage can give you a pretty bad one. Try not to go over 20 units at once.
  - rscadd: Bicaridine now gives you muscle spasms.
  - rscadd: Kelotane makes you drop your held items. Dermaline does the same, as it
      is now a subtype.
  - rscadd: Throwing beakers now shatters them. Be careful.
  - rscdel: Numbers have been deleted from scanners. Mostly. Stop using terms like
      brute and burn damage, boys.
  - rscadd: Taking a good chunk of damage at once now produces adrenaline. Acts like
      a painkiller and raises your pulse. Might also restart your heart.
  - tweak: Soulstones work only when someone's in asystole.
  - tweak: Changed how getting organ damage works. Lasers now deal organ damage.
  - tweak: Most organs can now take more punishment.
  - tweak: The head is now harder to hit.
  - tweak: The organ damage dealt now depends on the size of the organ in the area
      you hit.
  - tweak: Surgery pain is MUCH higher if you're awake.
  - tweak: Self surgery works again.
  - tweak: Using a scalpel on necrotic organs now fixes the necrosis. However, it'll
      also lower the organ's max damage as well.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - bugfix: Circuitry goggles have a sprite again now.

      gloves and 3x nitrile gloves, they have 2x latex gloves and 5x nitrile gloves.
  - rscadd: Added nitrile glove variants for Unathi and Tajara.
  - maptweak: Replaced most instances of latex gloves with nitrile gloves, and made
      xeno variants far more accessible. Latex allergies are no joke, kids.
  - imageadd: Changed the icon for the sterile gloves box to show a blue glove icon
      instead of white.
  Leudoberct1:
  - bugfix: Fixes the airlock vents in the digsite unique dungeon to function properly.

  aleksix:
  - bugfix: Integrated Circuits <ANY> pins will now accept lists.
2019-12-13:
  Doxxmedearly:
  - tweak: Pets have more discipline regarding food. They will no longer beg for food,
      seek it out, run towards it, steal it, or eat like there's an endless void in
      their stomachs. They'll still eat food on their tile if sufficiently hungry,
      and you can still feed pets by hand, if you'd like. Chefs, rejoice!
  - tweak: Corgi stomach capacity adjusted to a way more sane level.
  - rscdel: Removed guilty messages about pets starving when you examine them; they
      won't go hungry in a single shift, don't worry.
  - rscadd: You can brush most friendly animals. Combs work for fuzzy and feathered
      animals, rags work on other ones.
  - tweak: There's a small chance that when you pet a guard dog (like Columbo) on
      help intent (and aren't his master), he won't immediately maul your face off;
      instead, he will growl at you to warn you not to do that. I still don't recommend
      it.
  - tweak: Like other pets, baby carp can eat now. But not a lot.
  - bugfix: You'll no longer spray yourself with bottles or pepperspray when placing
      it into your bag, jacket, webbing, or a container you're holding, even with
