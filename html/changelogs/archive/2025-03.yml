  - qol: In keeping with recent lore developments, the clause for Orepit humans and
      Orepit IPCs no longer requires them to be Trinarists or in the Open Doors agreement.
      This also means that they can select more religions as well as have standard
      Coalition citizenship, and Orepit IPCs can select more accents.
