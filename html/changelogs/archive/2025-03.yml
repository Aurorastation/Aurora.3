  - qol: In keeping with recent lore developments, the clause for Orepit humans and
      Orepit IPCs no longer requires them to be Trinarists or in the Open Doors agreement.
      This also means that they can select more religions as well as have standard
      Coalition citizenship, and Orepit IPCs can select more accents.
  Snowy1237:

      turned on.

      camera and covered roughly the same area.

  - rscadd: Added Solarian Marine berets. They have green coloured and grey coloured
      variants, and can be found in Sol Marine uniform closets.
  nauticall:
  - refactor: Moves the data containing cargo items (i.e. the ones you order from
      ops and get in the cargo shuttle) from the online database to the codebase.
  - refactor: Refactors cargo items to use singletons instead of datums for cargo_supplier,
      cargo_category, and cargo_item. Multiple-instnace things like cargo_orders,
      etc. still use datums.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bunch of strange discrepancies in categories, suppliers, and pricing
      for various cargo items.
  - bugfix: Clicking the 'Details' button on the Cargo Order app now actually gives
      you details instead of bluescreening.
  - qol: Added some UI elements to the Cargo Order app to make it prettier and show
      tooltips on suppliers. Also now has search functionality.
