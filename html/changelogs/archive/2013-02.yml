  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: 'Added new surgery: putting items inside people. After you use retractor
      to keep incision open, just click with any item to put it inside. But be wary,
      if you try to fit something too big, you might rip the veins. To remove items,
      use implant removal surgery.'
  - rscadd: Crowbar can be used as alternative to retractor.
  - rscadd: Can now unload guns by clicking them in hand.
  - tweak: Fixed distance calculation in bullet missing chance computation, it was
      always assuming 1 or 0 tiles. Now distace REALLY matters when you shoot.
  - rscadd: To add more FUN to previous thing, bullets missed to not disappear but
      keep going until they hit something else.
  - bugfix: Compressed Matter and Explosive implants spawn properly now.
  - tweak: 'Tweaks to medical effects: removed itch caused by bandages. Chemical effects
      now have non-100 chance of appearing, the stronger medicine, the more probality
      it''ll have side effects.'

  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Change to body cavity surgery.  Can only put items in chest, groind and
      head. Max size for item - 3 (chest), 2 (groin), 1 (head). For chest surgery
      ribs should be bent open, (lung surgery until second scalpel step). Surgery
      step needs preparation step, with drill. After that you can place item inside,
      or seal it with cautery to do other step instead.

  Gamerofthegame:
  - rscadd: Added the (base gear) ERT preset for the debug command.
  - rscadd: Map fixes, Virology hole fixed. Atmospheric fixes for mining and, to a
      less extent, the science outpost. (No, not cycling airlocks)
  - rscadd: Fiddled with the ERT set up location on Centcom. Radmins will now have
      a even easier time equiping a team of any real pratical size, especially coupled
      with the above debug command.
