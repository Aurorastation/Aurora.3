  - rscadd: Changes the Dionae blurb to be more up to date.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Footstep animations from vision cones should now remove themselves a bit
      more promptly.
2020-10-27:
  Alberyk:
  - tweak: Spontaneous appendicitis should be rarer now.
  Ferner:
  - rscdel: Removed some unused scarfs in code.
  - tweak: Put winterboots in the loadout under boots, removed duplicate cowboy boots
      selection as these were already present under boot selection.
  MattAtlas:
  - tweak: If there are new polls, the poll button will now be highlighted.
  - tweak: You can no longer open the crew manifest before the game starts.
  NewOriginalSchwann:
  - tweak: Changes Deep Frontier (DFR) to Non-Coalition Frontier (NCF).
2020-10-28:
  Amunak:
  - admin: Admins now have a new secret to turn all light switches on, off or to their
      initial state.
  - backend: The 'area/set_lightswitch' proc can now be passed 'null' to set the area
      lights to initial state.
  Geeves:
  - rscadd: Examining trolleys and engines will now tell you whether they're being
      towed, or towing something, and what exactly those are.
  - rscadd: Mapped in various airlocks with one-way exits, meaning that you don't
      need access to exit if you come from that direction. This is primarily to let
      people out of departments without escorts.
  - rscadd: Added the option to put one-way exits in airlocks via airlock electronics.
  - bugfix: Creating stacks from material recipes will now update their icons to display
      their true fullness, such as making rods out of steel.
  - rscadd: Emitters now track how many shots they've fired, which gets reset when
      they get activated. Examine them while adjacent to them to read the value.
  - rscadd: Science can now print cargo trolley circuitboards, built with 15 power
      coils and 1 capacitor.
  - bugfix: Lobbysitter HUDs now properly update the Ready/Join button when the round
      starts.
  - rscadd: Part replacers now output the contents of closed machines nicely.
  - rscadd: Added dual wielding. Firing a gun while another is in the off-hand will
      fire that one as well, at the cost of lost accuracy. You must be on harm intent
      to do this.
  Hocka:
  - bugfix: Simple mobs revived by lazarus injectors now show their alive description
      text.
  Naelynn:
  - rscadd: Added Uranium Solidification chemmical reaction. Mix 20 units of liquid
      uranium, 5 units of frost oil and 5 units of potassium to create a sheet of
      uranium.
2020-10-30:
  Amunak:
  - bugfix: Fixes hardcoded health checks setting to 100 instead of maxHealth (mainly
      in godmode checks but also pAI).
  - rscadd: Added low level APCs (with just a regular battery), to be used in offices
      and other smaller, less critical areas. This allows long-term power loss to
      be of some consequence. Mapped into the security areas.
  - maptweak: Split upper security (investigations & training) into multiple per-room
      areas as it should be. Added light switches and APCs for those areas.
  - maptweak: The room with stairs to Training is now a part of the Training area,
      not Brig.
  - maptweak: Evidence Storage is now its own area as well.
  - maptweak: 'From security/brig there were two rooms split: the ''control room''
      and ''processing''. Also added APCs.'
  - tweak: Added back the option to toggle lights to most Security areas (basically
      everything but places where prisoners are held).
  - tweak: Added/modified area icons for most of the areas mentioned above for easier
      mapping.
  - rscdel: It is no longer possible to recycle any random crap in the Autolathe.
      It is now limited to 'reasonable' items such as stack materials, shards, tiles,
      reagent containers, power cells, shields and a handful of other things. Complex
      devices, guns, stuff that clearly wouldn't fit or doesn't make much sense to
      recycle (returns almost no useful materials) is no longer possible to recycle.
  - bugfix: It should be no longer possible to 'cheat' in the Autolathe by inserting
      items that give more materials than they cost to make in the Protolathe.
  - bugfix: Fixed a handful of the remaining problematic autolathe recipes / recyclation
      materials to not cost less than they're worth.
  - bugfix: 'Fixed stack material recipes to not create more product matter than they
      consume: metal rods and all floor tiles are now worth about half of their previous
      materials.'
  - bugfix: Fixes minor instatiation issues with hand teleporter and an organ when
      initialized in a non-typical way.
  - refactor: Moved the list of research designs to global level. This allows only
      single initialization of it.
  - backend: Added unit test to check if material costs of all research designs are
      greater than what can be gained from recycling their products.
  - backend: Added unit test to check if material costs of stack recipes are greater
      than what can be gained from recycling their products.
  - bugfix: Borers and other flips of the PASSEMOTES flag will no longer change the
      CANWEAKEN flag.
  Geeves:
  - tweak: Headsets' object sprites have been changed to fit their departmental colours.
  - rscadd: Added blood overlays to simple mobs.
  - rscadd: Dead antagonists now get their last words displayed at round end.
  - tweak: Small animals and nymphs can no longer wriggle out of bags or your hand
      when below 60% HP.
  JohnWildkins:
  - tweak: Rescue Pod and Visitor ghost spawners are now mid-round events, rather
      than a 10% chance to activate on round start.
  - rscadd: Added a new subtype of Rescue Pod, which sends a single burglar to the
      Aurora on non-extended rounds.
  - tweak: Decreased chances of Moderate Infestations, Carp Schools, and Rogue Drone
      events. Increased chances of Radiation Storm, Electrical Storm, and Communication
      Blackout events.
  - tweak: Changed Appendicitis chance to scale off slotted Surgeons, rather than
      medical staff. Rampant Brand Intelligence now scales off of engineers rather
      than janitors.
  - rscdel: Removed powergrid check event from rotation, boosted Electrical Storm
      chance to compensate.
  The Stryker, NiennaB:
  - rscadd: Added circle and horn antennas to the loadout (Xenowear - IPC, antenna
      selection).
  - rscadd: Added ripped jeans under the pants selection in the loadout, as well as
      a colorable jumpsuit in the uniforms tab.
  - rscadd: Added a Himeo engineering and atmos voidsuit that can be made with the
      Himeo voidsuit kit and an existing engineering/atmos voidsuit.
  - tweak: The Himeo suit sprite no longer has side views when dragged.
  - tweak: IPC antennae sprites have been changed to be smaller.
  Wowzewow (Wezzy):
  - bugfix: EPMC cap should be now lore appropriate colored.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Power cells now drain to exactly zero when it fails to completely satisfy
      a power demand. This will solve cases where the game thought cells with an extremely
      small amount of power weren't empty. e.g. Out of power robots that could not
      move not being able to use their Power Warning verb.
2020-10-31:
  Amunak:
  - rscadd: Starting message when joining as an AI has been moved to a separate pop-up
      window and expanded. It is now also available as a verb 'AI-Help'. This prevents
      message spam when they start while providing more information to new players.
      It also contains OOC info noting that players should be mindful of not ruining
      fun for others.
  - rscadd: Airlocks hacking UI now shows pretty colors for the values. Also tweaked
      some messages and display of the UI. Most importantly, when power is off the
      message is now simplified to 'all the lights are off'.
  - rscadd: Whether AIs can or cannot bolt airlocks is now determined by new states
      of the 'AI control' wire. It is no longer just 'off' (or cut or emagged) and
      'on'. It can be 'off' (cut), 'red' (emagged), 'orange' (AI can control doors
      but not bolt them) or 'green' (AI can bolt or unbolt the doors). Pulsing the
      control wire toggles between green and orange, cutting and emagging still works
      the same. Some airlocks are 'locked' (can be mapped or changed by subtype; currently
      high security doors do this) and pulsing the control wire does nothing.
  - rscadd: The 'AI control' state of most airlocks defaults to whether the airlock
      is locked (mappers and airlock subtypes can override this). This means that
      most airlocks are by default 'orange', so AIs cannot drop (or raise!) bolts
      on the vast majority of airlocks. The exception are secure airlocks, hatches
      (like on tcommsat) and external airlocks whose bolts can be controlled by the
      AI (in case of external airlocks most are bolted anyway, so AI would have bolt
      control regardless).
  - rscadd: There is now an announcement and a delay of 8 seconds for raising and
      4 seconds for dropping the bolts by AIs (traitor AIs are not affected by this,
      though they can choose to 'fake' it). High security doors have even higher delays
      (10/5) and vault has the highest (12/8). It is also no longer possible to spam
      the message - only one action can be done at a time and AIs must wait for it
      to complete.
  - tweak: Tweaked some AI airlock action messages to facilitate the above changes.
      Additionally the bolt announcement message is now an audible instead of visual.
  - tweak: AIs, when using 'Radio Settings', now see their radio channel keys. They
      are also displayed in 'AI-Help'.
  - bugfix: Door now properly updates icon when it regains power.
  - backend: Moved code that gathers radio channels for AI to a separate proc.
  - admin: Fixes admin check in airlock VueUI. Also allows admins to actually toggle
      stuff like bolts, safeties and electrification. De-admin yourself if you want
      to actually play!
  - refactor: Refactored some of the airlock code, especially stuff regarding displaying
      messages and toggling bolts. Some of it was necessary for these changes, other
      parts I think I just made more readable.
  Ferner:
  - maptweak: The research shuttle can now also be docked at yellow dock.
  Flpfs:
  - tweak: Service cyborgs can now pick up clams and molluscs.
  Geeves:
  - admin: Projectiles hitting mobs will now not display an admin log if both the
      firer and the target has no client connected.
  - rscadd: Autohissssss has been added to the character creation menu, and will now
      perssssisssst roundssss and logoutssss.
  - rscadd: Diona now absorb knowledge along with language when sucking blood, this
      is a user prompt that the suckee must enter, and will probably fail to.
  - rscadd: Diona gestalts can now also sample DNA to learn languages and gain knowledge.
  - rscadd: Diona now inject a medium painkiller when sucking blood, called 'Aphrodite'.
  Hocka:
  - tweak: Airlocks now display messages when crushing people.
  JohnWildkins:
  - rscadd: Vending machines now have a graphical, icon-based item interface based
      in VueUI.
  - tweak: Vending machines now have a search bar.
  - bugfix: Icon lag when using vending machines should no longer exist.
  - tweak: Updated the Aut'akh religion lore blurb.
  Naelynn:
  - rscadd: Allows Vaurca to select generic augment loadout items.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Antagonists hiding inside something (locker, chameleon projection, etc.)
      at round end will now appear properly in the end-of-round antag display text.
