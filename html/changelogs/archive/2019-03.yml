      CE, industiral, AMI, hazard(Security), combat, hacker(illegal), stealth(illegal,
      shitty ninja knockoff). The process of construction is similar to Mechs. Civillian
      RIGs require wires, central board, steel sheets. Combat(and illegal) RIGS require:
      wires, central board, control and targeting board, advanced scanning module,
      steel sheets, plasteel sheets. All circuit boards for RIGS are now in RND research
      designs. RIG assembly frames need to be researched prior to them showing up
