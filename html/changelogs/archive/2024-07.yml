  - bugfix: Spark hangar is now vacuum, allowing the shuttle to use its sensors while
      docked.
  - rscadd: Spark airlock optimised to cycle more efficiently, and to handle air-to-air
      cycling without flooding the shuttle with foreign gas. Merge valve now starts
      disabled. Fuel connector now pumps into the fuel tank, rather than directly
      into the thrusters.
