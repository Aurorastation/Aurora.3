      if they merge or grow into one. Nymphs splitting from a gestalt have a chance
      to inherit each language, otherwise they will forget it. Forgetting how to speak
      or understand basic is possible.

      they must learn basic. In addition, all diona have rootsong as their default
      language on roundstart.
