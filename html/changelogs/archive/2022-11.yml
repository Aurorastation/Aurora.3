  KingOfThePing:
  - rscadd: Adds halloween costumes and decorations.
  - maptweak: Tweaks the Idris cruise map slightly with halloween additions.
  - rscadd: Adds an alternative bright yellow high visibility jacket from Shiptest.
      It has two pocket slots. Available in the loadout under the jacket selection.
  MattAtlas:
  - rscadd: When you input a message to announce through the Command console, your
      character now speaks the message, which gets recorded and then replayed as the
      announcement. This means that auto-hiss will translate over to your announcements!
  - maptweak: Moved the requests console in the first responder bay.
  - bugfix: The crew armoury carbines no longer spawn with full-fat 5.56.

  - tweak: The blackbox and the common server in telecomms had their positions swapped
      so people can repair the common server easier.
  - tweak: Extended the fore hallway area to the spot between the bar and kitchen.
      It used to all be considered a bar area, so those lights would start off and
      It&#x27;d all be enveloped in darkness.
  - tweak: The central primary hallway was considered a singular area all way from
      the entrance to operations to the giant room with the stargazer. The stargazer
      area in particular is now considered a different area, which will stress out
      the poor singular APC that&#x27;s been powering it all far less, as it has its
      own APC now.

      Bone&quot; and renames the &quot;Mend closed bone&quot; surgery to &quot;Repair

2022-11-05:
  MattAtlas (Code), Kyres1 (Sprites, Mapping):
  - rscadd: 'Added a ship to ship combat system! The basic functioning is that each
      ship has at least four entry points that can be targeted. Projectiles enter
      these entrypoints based on the heading of the ship that fired them. Ex: if you
      are facing the starboard of a ship, and you fire to hit the aft, you will miss.'
  - rscadd: The Horizon now has its own guns! They were fitted in the last few port
      calls. The Leviathan (accessible by Engineering &amp; Command) is on the port
      ballast on Deck 2. The Grauwolf, a flak cannon, is fore of Operations. The Longbow,
      a 406mm artillery gun, is port of the Bridge. The Intrepid has been fitted with
      a 40mm rotary gun, the Francisca.
  - rscadd: To target an overmap object with a gun, go to a targeting console (found
      on the Bridge for the Horizon), open the targeting grid and then click an overmap
      object that you can see. You will then lock onto it.
  - rscadd: To load ammunition into a gun, load the respective shell or bundle or
      whatever you might need into the ammunition loader next to the gun.
  - rscadd: The Leviathan has a fairly complex activation sequence! All details can
      be found in the envelope found in its holding bay.
  - rscadd: Certain guns, like the Grauwolf, can be used to destroy some overmap hazards.
  - rscadd: When targeting multi-z maps like the Horizon, you are able to select a
      z-level to filter the entry points.
  - rscadd: Ship ammunition can be very heavy. If it is, it can only be lifted by
      G2s/G1s/Vaurca Breeders/Bulwarks, by a human in a rig or by a mech clamp. Ripleys
      spawn in the Longbow, Francisca and Grauwolf&#x27;s compartments.
  - rscadd: The helm console has four new buttons under the Maneuvers section. The
      two that look like turning arrows will perform an emergency combat dodge which
      moves the ship by one tile to the left or right, a fairly dangerous maneuver
      that throws everyone on the ship around, unless buckled. The second set that
      looks like arrows with a line at the end will instead turn the ship 45 degrees
      to the left or right, useful for turning to face enemy ships to shoot them.
      This is markedly less dangerous and only puts unbuckled people on the floor.
      It&#x27;s also not as loud.
  - tweak: The Mining Shuttle has officially been given the name of SCCV Spark.
  - bugfix: You can no longer see overmap objects through darkness.
  WickedCybs:
  - rscadd: Shuttles won&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re jumping into bluespace anymore,
      as they were not anyway. It will look like they&#x27;re actually flying through
      space.

  - tweak: Francisca normal ammo now has 1 more penetration so that it actually gets
      through hulls.
  - bugfix: Maneuvers now work correctly. Do note that the left/right distinction
      is relative to ship direction ONLY for combat rolls, whereas it is absolute
      for combat turning (imagine a compass).
  - bugfix: Physical ship ammunition projectiles now have hit sound effects.
  - bugfix: Ship weapon projectiles no longer miss when they enter a ship. Get down
      if you want to dodge them!

      all have grauwolf flak batteries. The militia ship has a 40mm rotary cannon.
      The civilian station has a large amount of ammunition to sell.
  - balance: Some third party ships and away sites have had their small arms to be
      more substantial. The civilian station now has an autolathe.
  WickedCybs:
  - backend: Organizes all the away site and ship files. They each have their own
      folders. The generic folder was renamed to awaysite.
  - backend: Seperates the wildcard and corporate ship file as it was being shared
      by the tramp freighter + milita and the ox ship and ee ship respectively.

  WickedCybs, MattAtlas:

      in functionality but scaled up to provide consistent power for the ships you

      involves adding coolant.
  - tweak: Generators have some really high power values that had to be scaled down.
      It&#x27;s still too high probably but further adjustments need some planning.
2022-11-23:
  Alberyk:
  - rscadd: 'Added a new third party ship: the Orbital Fleet Database Freighter.'

      to the warehouse.
  - tweak: Adds a carbon dioxide holding tank to the Kataphract ship to eliminate
      any reliance on filling and removing cans from the fuel line. It&#x27;s unlikely
      they will run out of fuel during a round.

      supplies. This includes a nanomed.
  - tweak: The Kataphract Quartermaster role has been renamed to &#x27;Kataphract
      Specialist&#x27;.

      bags among other things.

      the level of the average merc voidsuit now.

  - rscadd: Away site hangars have more transit spots, so ships are more likely to
      be able to land in them.
