changes:
  - rscadd: "Buffed the help intent shuffle. Pulled objects will no longer be dropped."
  - rscadd: "When doing the shuffle and pulling a dense object, shuffling through someone will move both you and the object past your target."
  - rscadd: "When doing the shuffle and you're pulling a non-dense object, you will shuffle as normal, but your object will move to beneath the target's feet, allowing movement."
  - rscadd: "Shuffling past someone while grabbing someone will move the grabbed person / peoples to your tile after the shuffle completes, maintaining your grip."
  - tweak: "When both you and your shuffle target are pulling dense objects, the help intent shuffle will no longer occur."
