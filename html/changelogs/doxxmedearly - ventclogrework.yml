changes:
  - tweak: "Reworked scrubber backsurge odds to make certain things like mindbreaker less common. Reagent amounts are randomized now, instead of always being 35u."
  - rscadd: "Added more reagent variety to backsurge events, as well as paint color variety."
  - rscadd: "Added a cap so that backsurge sprays will never exceed a reagent's overdose threshold, which should help prevent deaths due to the event."
