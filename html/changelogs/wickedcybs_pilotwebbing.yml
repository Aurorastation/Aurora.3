changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new webbing accessory, a webbing harness which was taken from Polaris and tweaked. There are three variants to pick from in the loadout. Recolourable versions too."
  - tweak: "The FSF synthetic unit now gets a pilot helmet and exchanges its holster for a webbing harness."
  - tweak: "The TCFL pilot has had their sidearm slightly reflavoured, it's now an enhanced blaster pistol. Their holster has also been swapped for a webbing harness for a piloty aesthetic."
  - maptweak: "Mapped in the new harnesses to a few offstation antag roles, like merc. Burglars can also select from more than just holsters now, in case they want to use a webbing."
