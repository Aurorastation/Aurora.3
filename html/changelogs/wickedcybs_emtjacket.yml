changes:
  - tweak: "The dark green first responder jacket can now hold medical equipment in its suit slot. Both responder jackets can hold a helmet in the suit slot like the chest rig can, too."
  - tweak: "Tweaked the side sprites of the open dark green first responder jacket as it was identical to how it looked when closed."
  - tweak: "Condenses a lot of the common first responder suit wear, like the chest rig and vest into its own selection to tidy up the loadout a bit. Look for the medical outerwear selection to reselect stuff or browse the more expanded options. You will have to reselect your gear from the new selection."
  - tweak: "Condenses the IAC suit gear into its own outwear catagory too. You will have to reselect your gear from the new selection."
