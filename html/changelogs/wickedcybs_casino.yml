changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new away site that features a mysteriously empty casino ship. It might prove interesting to the dauntless expedition teams of the Horizon and others occupying the overmap."
  - rscadd: "Added a new away site that features another mysteriously empty vessel. Far smaller than the casino, it's a space yacht. This was also ported from bay."
  - rscadd: "Added a hydrogen tank subtype for shuttles as well as a fuel port subtype that starts with a hydrogen tank already inserted inside. Others in the spur often have to make due without phoron, so this is for thematic reasons."
  - rscadd: "Added the various wood types from bay. These are mainly things to be mapped in, at the moment"
  - rscadd: "Ported all the fancy bay carpets."
