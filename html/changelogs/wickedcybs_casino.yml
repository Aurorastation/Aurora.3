changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new away site that features a mysteriously empty casino ship. It might prove interesting to the dauntless expedition teams of the Horizon and others occupying the overmap."
  - rscadd: "Added a hydrogen tank subtype for shuttles as well as a fuel port subtype that starts with a hydrogen tank already inserted inside. Others in the spur often have to make due without phoron, so this is for thematic reasons."
