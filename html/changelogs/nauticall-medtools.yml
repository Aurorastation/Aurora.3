# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - imageadd: "Resprited all basic surgical tools as well as the surgical tray they rest on. They can now be clicked with a higher than 30% accuracy rate and look, subjectively, prettier than before."
  - imageadd: "Also resprited the basic and premium hyposprays to be up to modern standards. They, too, are now subjectively prettier."
  - tweak: "Changed descriptions of surgical tools and also renamed the FixOVein to the vascular recoupler."
