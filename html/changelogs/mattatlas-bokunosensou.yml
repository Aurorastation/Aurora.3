# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

changes:
  - experiment: "Human mobs now get knocked out by pain sooner; from 200 halloss to 120."
  - experiment: "Pain decay nerfs have been reverted as well."
  - tweak: "Disruptor projectiles have been buffed. They now knock down a human mob in about six shots, and they have 10 shots available before recharging."
  - tweak: "Nerfed shotgun lethal pellets."
  - tweak: "Adrenaline has been nerfed once again, now only having its full effect for a short amount of time. Its jittering now happens when the dose is very high, instead of at a mediocre amount."
  - backend: "Reworked how disruptor lethal authorization works in the backend. No user-facing changes."
  - tweak: "Touched up wireless firing mode failure messages and added a sound to gun registration."
  - tweak: "All gun agony damage now goes through the siemens coefficient."
  - tweak: "Stun baton pain damage has been slightly nerfed to compensate."
  - tweak: "Security's non-lethal guns now do one burn damage. Think of it as flavour."
