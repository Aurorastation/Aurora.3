  - bugfix: "Sleepers will no longer jettison their stored components when you exit them."
  - bugfix: "Vampires approaching frenzy will now get their appropriate messages again."

  - imageadd: "Added a second lobby screen, courtesy of NursieKitty and Zelm."
  - tweak: "Wizards can no longer upgrade spacebats into an instant-summon. The ability to spam mobs is bad ju-ju."
