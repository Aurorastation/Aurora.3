changes: 
  - tweak: "Brain traumas are now no longer constant. They are assigned specific triggers upon creation and manifest only when those triggers are present."
  - tweak: "The chakra therapy pod has been replaced with the hallucinatory therapy pod, which uses narcotics to cure traumas based on specific triggers."
  - rscdel: "Removed surgical, hypnotic, and isolation therapies."
  - rscdel: "Clowns can no longer cure traumas."
  - rscadd: "Adds brain traumas for IPCs, otherwise known as hardware faults, which are cured by the roboticist instead of medical. Unlike organic brain traumas, they have no triggers and are constant."
