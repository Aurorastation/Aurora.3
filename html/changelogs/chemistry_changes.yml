# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Pill labels now have doses listed on them. Vague pill names such as 'sleeping pill' and 'anti-toxin' have been replaced with the proper names; 'soporific', 'dylovene'."
  - tweak: "RMT has been tweaked to avoid throwing up due to pills going over the stomach capacity. 1 pill now contains 15u, as opposed to 30u; 10 pills per bottle, instead of 7 - should last 4 hours."
  - balance: "Saline Plus has been nerfed and is no longer equivalanet to 3 blood bags. The metabolisation rate has been increased to achieve this, so drips should be set to ~1.5u/t instead of ~0.8u/t."
  - tweak: "Saline Plus' recipe has been simplified a tad following feedback, but remains expensive and a degree difficult to make. It is now 2 parts Water, 0.2 parts Sugar, 0.4 parts Salt."
  - tweak: "Perconol bottles will now appear in NanoMed Venders for use treating minor pain. Mortaphenyl is more suited for treating severe pain due to the side-effects that come with it."
