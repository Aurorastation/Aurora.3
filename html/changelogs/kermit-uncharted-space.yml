  - rscadd: "Also adds an uncharted Lemurian Sea variant."
  - rscadd: "Adds the ccia_link variable which can be used to stop outbound faxes to the CCIA. For uncharted sectors, such as the Crescent Expanse's far sector."
  - rscadd: "Adds low supply variant of most vending machines and dispensers for later use. Ominous."
  - rscdel: "Removes the guaranteed spawn flag from the sensors relay, deferring to the usual whitelist/blacklist system."
  - rscdel: "Burzsia is no longer a 'dangerous' system following completion of relief efforts."
