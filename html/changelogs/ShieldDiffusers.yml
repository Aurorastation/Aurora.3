changes:
  - rscadd: "Added shield diffusers. They prevent shielding on adjacent turfs, allowing e.g. the supermatter to be ejected while shielding is online."
  - rscadd: "The bubble shield generator now has the option for multi-z shields."
  - tweak: "Changed what kind of turfs hull shields make shields on. They should no longer make shields within the station/ship."
