changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a mounted foam sprayer to the mechfab hardsuit modules tab. It's a hardsuit module that consumes 1500 cell charge to spray a line of metal foam."
  - rscadd: "Added some effects to metal foam walls that make them a bit more flashy when destroyed, as well as adding a click cooldown so they can't be spammed down."
  - rscadd: "Clicking on a metal foam wall with building materials will now attempt to turn it into a wall, taking a bit longer than a standard girder would. Clicking on it with a floor tile will now turn it into plating, if the space below is an open space or actual space."
