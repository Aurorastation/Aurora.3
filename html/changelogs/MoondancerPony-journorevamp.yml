changes: 
  - tweak: "Tweaks a lot of things to do with newscasters. Maybe there will be a fancy new UI soon? Who knows."
  - rscdel: "Removes the Journalist alt-title from Librarian."
  - rscadd: "Adds the Corporate Reporter job and the Freelance Journalist alt-title. Corporate Reporters have more liability and responsibility, but have greater access and legitimacy. Freelance journalists have no such restrictions, but are all on their own. To add to this, there are now two press passes- a normal and a corporate one. These do not guarantee you anything from Security or Command, however, so be warned!"
  - maptweak: "The merchandise store has been replaced with a brand-new journalist's office, set up for interviews and writing. Journalists also get their own pet."
  - experiment: "You can now comment, like, and dislike newscaster stories. PDAs can see, but not interact with, the new newscaster functionality. PDA news features may expand or be removed in the future."
