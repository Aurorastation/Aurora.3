changes: 
  - backend: "Tweaked how various bee related items work, subtle non-intended differences might be noticeable, however all should be positive."
  - rscadd: "Examining a beehive now gives you more information. It's still better to use a plant analyzer on it to get detailed information, however."
  - tweak: "Bees now only get angry AFTER you disassemble their hive, not when you click it with a screwdriver. Gives you some time to cancel the move."
  - rscadd: "Bees in a beehive now affect the yield of plants in view, having a positive effect the more bees there are. They also still positively benefit plant health."
  - rscadd: "Examining the honey extractor now shows whether it contains a frame, and its centrifuge action now only takes 10 seconds, down from 20."
  - tweak: "Tweaked the bee smoker's examine a little. Nothing new, but it should look better now."
  - tweak: "Tweaked some bee smoker messages to look better."
