changes:
  - maptweak: "Removed a lot of railings in maintenance to make it more maneuverable."
  - maptweak: "Added an abandoned maintenance room with engineering supplies at the deck one med maint."
  - maptweak: "Added more maintenance entrances and exits to deck three. Mainly affects security but there is also now a maintenance exit in the locker room."
  - maptweak: "Tweaked the layout of some maintenance rooms on every deck to make it easier to move around or hide."
  - maptweak: "A lot of the maintenance bins are now closets. Those don't block movement once opened and can be used for various purposes."
  - maptweak: "Maintenance in general should be a lot more consistent in style throughout the ship rather than have drastic differences such as between areas like port deck one maint vs the rest of the ship."
