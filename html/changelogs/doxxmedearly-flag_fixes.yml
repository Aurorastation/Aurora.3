changes:
  - bugfix: "You can no longer tear down a flag from a distance by leaving the dialogue box up."
  - bugfix: "Torn flags are no longer invisible."
  - bugfix: "When you use a screwdriver to take down a flag, you get the proper item back (if it's not torn up!), meaning you can place them again easily."
