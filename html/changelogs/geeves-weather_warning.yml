changes:
  - rscadd: "Atmospheric probes will now relay changes in weather when deployed. Analog radios can be tuned into the weather broadcast and receive it, provided they're in the same sector / connected z-levels."
  - bugfix: "Fixed weather transitions to rainy / icy weather not working."
  - qol: "Changed rainy / icy weather to have a blue color, reducing eye strain."
