changes: 
  - rscdel: "Removes cryoxadone and clonexadone."
  - rscadd: "Adds two new chemicals, anadaxon and feredaxon, to replace cryoxadone and clonexadone. They are still used in the recipe for peridaxon."
  - rscadd: "Anadaxon treats genetic damage. Feredaxon treats genetic damage, slight brain damage, and is a mild painkiller."
  - rscdel: "Removed cryo cells entirely. They were bad code."
  - maptweak: "Added more sleepers and patient beds to Medical."
  - rscadd: "You can now detect potential internal bleeding as well as foreign bodies by targeting the limb you want to check when scanning."
  - experiment: "Non-advanced scanners have a chance for false positives for internal bleeding depending on how much brute damage has been done to the limb."
  - rscdel: "Removes advanced scanners from the map; Research can still build them for Medical."
