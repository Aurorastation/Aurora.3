# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - imageadd: "Resprited all jeans, black pants and colorable dress pants."
  - rscdel: "Removed tan, khaki, red, white pants due to the existance of colorable dress pants. All maps and outfits where these were used now use black pants (I did not want to put in the effort)."
