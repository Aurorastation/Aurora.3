changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added three new gamemodes: Tower Defense, Bughunt, Spy vs. Spy."
  - rscadd: "Bughunt, mercenary and borer, needs twenty required players and five required enemies."
  - tweak: "Borers have received some miscellaneous fixes and tweaks across the board. They should overall work better now."
  - rscadd: "Borers can now awaken psionics in their hosts. Maybe it's not a bad idea to get a brain slug after all..."
  - rscadd: "Spy vs. Spy, traitor and renegade, needs four required players."
  - tweak: "Changed how renegades work a bit. You're not traitors! You're paranoid people who smuggled a gun to work and are working to keep themselves safe."
  - rscadd: "Tower Defense, mercenary, heist and ninjas, needs thirty required players and ten required enemies. Good luck!"
