changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added 108 hairstyles and 12 facial hairstyles for Humans/Shells, 3 hairstyles for Vox, 3 variant hairstyles and 4 variant facial hairstyles for Unathi, 1 facial hairstyle for Tajara, 3 screens for Baseline IPCs; from Polaris, BS12, Para, tg, and including a small few from yours truly."
  - refactor: "Renamed hairstyles so that they may hopefully be more convenient to find on a hairstyle list -- be sure to check your character setup in case you're bald!"
  - spellcheck: "Rewrote the hair tugging messages so that they may show up in lower case."
  - bugfix: "Fixed hair name values and lengths so that they may appear on the Character Setup and Hair Tie lists, with 6 hairstyles being readded."
  - tweak: "For the next gen devs: rearranged the code and icon_states in the sprite_accessories and appropriate hair.dmi files so that they are mostly in alphabetical order and correspond to each other's positions."
