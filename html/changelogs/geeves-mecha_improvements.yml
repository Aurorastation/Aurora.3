  - rscadd: "Mecha movement and equipment usage cooldowns have been decoupled. You can now move directly after using your equipment, which makes them MUCH less clunky to use."
  - rscadd: "Mecha hardpoint UI elements will now get tinted red during their cooldowns, which will turn back to normal once the equipment can be used again."
  - tweak: "Mecha UI text have been overhauled to look much prettier."
  - tweak: "The charge level for mechs is now displayed as a percentage value, and actually fits on the screen."
