changes:
  - imagedel: "Deleted old borghypo sprite"
  - imageadd: "Cleaned and tweaked the old borghypo into something cleaner with visible volume number displayed. The Lazarus Injector has received a completely new and unique sprite as well, in-hands included."
  - tweak: "Cyborg Medical Synthesizers inject twice as fast as normal hyposprays, and also make the hypo hissing sound when injecting people. Added Coagzolug for Rescue modules."
  - bugfix: "Added missing in-hands for autoinhalers, and fixed using autoinhalers/autoinjectors not automatically update the in-hand icon when used."
