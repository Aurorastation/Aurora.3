changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds non-z-level-traversing ramps, which work like stairs but they are safe to pull objects onto. Replaced some of the more frustrating stairs with ramps."
  - rscadd: "Slightly remaps medical to allow their lift to reach the third deck as well."
  - bugfix: "Stairs now check for gravity before having objects fall down them."
