changes:
  - bugfix: "Items can no longer be placed through closed windoors, nor can mobs be attacked past them."
  - tweak: "Windoors are now affected by power loss; non-secure (brig) windoors no longer check for access, but must be pushed open. Brig windoors lock shut and cannot be moved without power."
