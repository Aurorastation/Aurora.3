changes:
  - rscadd: "Hyronalin now causes Diona to receive toxin damage. For reference 10 units will get Diona into cirtical state within 3:30 minutes. 15 unit will kill."
  - rscadd: "Arithrazine now causes Diona to receive deadly toxin damage. Even 5u will kill Diona within 1:03 minutes"
  - rscadd: "Tea now causes Diona to receive toxin damage. Tiny bit more then how it cures radiation for other species."
  - rscadd: "Radium now cures toxin damage for Diona. You would need at least 1/3 more of it to cure same amount of Hyronalin effect."
