  - bugfix: "You can now actually get drunk again(The unexpectedly high time delta was the culprit here)."
  - rscadd: "Stasis sources(Such as cryogenics, stasis bags, and stasis beds) now decrease the rate at which brain damage is both healed and accumulated. Thus, they now properly buy time for medics."
