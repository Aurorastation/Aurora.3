changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds a major new feature: Cargo stocking. Now the cargo bay, and especially the warehouse, will come pre-stocked with a large variety of assorted junk, supplies and useful oddities, intended for distributing to whoever on the station will enjoy/use them the most."
  - rscadd: "Potted plants now have varied sprites instead of always being the same."
  - tweak: "Small animals can now crawl over crates. Crates will now only block bullets sometimes. Also a few insects had their density fixed."
  - bugfix: "Clusterbangs and Floor layer machines now function properly. Maybe you'll find them in cargo..."
  - rscadd: "Added a bountiful new event!"
