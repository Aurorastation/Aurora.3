changes:
  - maptweak: "The Intrepid has been remapped to lose its rightmost airlock. In exchange the little engine nacelle has been expanded into a full fledged room that will supply both ship thrusters. It also includes a power source and the scrubbers canister. The rest of the Intrepid has had minor tweaks for ease of use. such as handrails within the airlocks, additional scrubbers and air vents, a medical sleeper and a bit more."
  - balance: "The Intrepid and Mining Pod now require power to stay operational. They have SMES's that are topped with power and can get more just by landing back at the Horizon, or via alternate means like a generator if it really comes to it!"
  - rscadd: "Added handrails. This is a type of object you can buckle onto securely to avoid getting knocked into stuff due to acceleration. They're usually found in shuttle airlocks. Sprite is from Baystation."
