# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Space A/Cs will now start with a heavy duty cell instead of a basic cell that dies in half a minute."
  - tweak: "Space A/Cs now heat and cool slightly faster."
  - rscadd: "Space A/Cs can now be emagged, which increases the range they can heat and cool, as well as improving their efficiency. Temperature-sensitive species, Tremble!"
  - tweak: "Interacting with space A/Cs is slightly different. If the panel is closed and you click it, it brings up the interface menu, which allows you to turn it on and off, as well as adjust the temperature. Before, the panel needed to be opened for you to adjust the temperature."
  - tweak: "Power cells in space A/Cs are no longer removed via menu; if the panel is open, you only need to click with an empty hand to remove it, or click with a cell in-hand to insert it."
  - bugfix: "Borgs should now be able to change the power cells of space A/Cs."
