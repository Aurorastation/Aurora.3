# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - qol: "Under the chat settings, you can now press \"Adjust UI Sizes\" to drag around some of the panel sizes."
  - bugfix: "The input at the bottom right is no longer so teeny tiny on 516 if you use a window scaling that is greater than 100%."
  - qol: "There's a new UI preference called UI scale which allows people that use windows scaling to have their UIs original size with the contents zoomed out, instead of the default, which is the UIs being larger with the contents 'normal' size."
  - bugfix: "Various UIs did not respect windows scaling, they now do."
