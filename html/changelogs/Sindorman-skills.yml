  - rscadd: "Chracter skills now play role in gameplay. Being skilled at something will grant you buff in delay reductions, chances and accuracy., but having no skill does not give a penalty. Added two more new skills: Prospecting and Sanitizing. All of the skills except for management will give you buffs. Examples are if you are wrenching an atmos pipe, you will have reduced delay depending on your level of construction skill and atmos skill. Delay reductions range from 0 to 45%. To see detailed explanation on which skill affects what delay/chance/buff look at https://github.com/Aurorastation/Aurora.3/pull/8240 PR description."
