changes:
  - tweak: "Opaque objects on the overmap no longer block your mob's vision, meaning you'll be able to see other datalinked ship's detected objects. However, your sensors will still only be able to detect what it can see."
  - rscdel: "Removed the repeating sound that sensors make, they only make a sound when they detect or lose something now."
  - tweak: "Ships no longer lose their datalink unless the sensors get destroyed."
  - tweak: "The contact list no longer shows the datalink button for ships you're already linked to."
  - rscadd: "Shuttles now automatically datalink to their mothership."
