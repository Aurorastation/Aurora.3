changes:
  - tweak: "Opaque objects on the overmap no longer block your mob's vision, meaning you'll be able to see other datalinked ship's detected objects. However, your sensors will still only be able to detect what it can see."
  - tweak: "Replaced the repeating sound that sensors make with a gentler sonar sound, also added a Console Ambience preferences to turn it on and off (make sure you toggle it on if you want to hear it)."
  - tweak: "Ships no longer lose their datalink unless the sensors get destroyed."
  - tweak: "The contact list no longer shows the datalink button for ships you're already linked to."
  - rscadd: "Shuttles now automatically datalink to their mothership."
  - rscadd: "Docked shuttles' sensors now work."
