changes:
  - rscadd: "You can now make an easel out of 5 wood, and a canvas of various sizes out of cloth. To draw on the canvas, use a crayon on it, to clean, use soap or a rag. Using the canvas in-hand will completely clean it."
  - tweak: "Bookcases now drop all the materials used to make them when dismantled."
