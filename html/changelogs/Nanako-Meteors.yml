changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where almost half of all meteors spawned would instantly delete without hitting anything"
  - bugfix: "Meteors that impact energy shields will no longer bug out and spin forever in space"
  - rscadd: "Meteor showers and storms now last a lot longer, and are far more punishing if the station isn't shielded"
  - rscadd: "Meteors are now far more likely to make an audible explosion on impact. Explosion power reduced a bit though"
  - rscadd: "Meteor events now give a three minute advance warning, allowing time to turn on station shield generators"
  - rscadd: "All meteors that impact a shield now make a special sound effect."
  - tweak: "Small and normal sized meteors are now vaporised harmlessly on contact with a shield. Large meteors will explode, but with reduced power"
