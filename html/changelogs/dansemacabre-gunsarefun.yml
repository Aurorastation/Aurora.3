changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new reagent called Sanasomnum to the uplink for 2 TCs, which induces a regenerative paralysis that can heal almost any type of damage, including bone breaks, brain damage, arterial bleeding, and organ damage, at the cost of roughly four minutes of being unable to move."
  - rscadd: "Added a new type of 5.56 bullet, 5.56 polymer."
  - balance: "Added a bullpup carbine, two 9mm machine pistols, and two boxes of buckshot to the sec armory."
  - balance: "Added the ballistic carbine and ammo to the uplink, the L6 LMG and ammo to the uplink, and the energy pistol."
  - balance: "Changed telecrystals counts across the board - most antags with access to the uplink will have 20 TCs now. Mercs still have 15 TCs, with their own unique uplink."
  - balance: "Raiders now have uplinks, with 3 TCs each."
  - balance: "Minigun TC cost increased to 40 TC."

  - balance: "Rezadone is now blacklisted from spawning in cargo crates."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where the horror form would die at 2/3rds health."
