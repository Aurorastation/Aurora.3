changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds a new rare event, \"Space-time Anomailes\", which gives a few lucky people split personality, imaginary friend, or bluespace prophet."
  - tweak: "Tweaked the announcements of other events. Disallowed the gravity event not have a fake event. Tweaked the powernet failure event so all APCS regardless of time are reset after 300 seconds. Viral outbreaks are rarer and would only occur with plentiful medical staff."
