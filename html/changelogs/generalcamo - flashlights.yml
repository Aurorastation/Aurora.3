  - bugfix: "The lantern and maglight's on states are actually used."
  - bugfix: "Added more sanity checking to catch illegal calls in flashlights."
  - refactor: "Cleaned up flashlight code to make it more flexible."
  - imageadd: "Added a sprite for device power cells. (Credit to Pebbles, Baystation12.)"
  - imageadd: "Power cells now have a distinct sprite for low power, and no power."
  - rscadd: "Added advanced device power cells. (Sprite credit to Pebbles, Baystation12.)"
  - soundadd: "Added sounds for toggling flashlights, and the green desk lamp."
  - tweak: "Flashlights are now fabricated from plastic, instead of steel."
  - tweak: "Electronic cigarettes now use device power cells. Power consumption has been reduced in half to compensate."
