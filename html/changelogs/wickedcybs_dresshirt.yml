changes:
  - rscadd: "Added an alternate dress shirt to the shirt selection in the loadout. It has more detail and colours nicely"
  - tweak: "All the loadout dress shirts can now have their sleeves rolled up by using the roll up shirt sleeves verb. This has to be done while it's not attached to your uniform. Pre-rolled dress shirts can still be selected too."
