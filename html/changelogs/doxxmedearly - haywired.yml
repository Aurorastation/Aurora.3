changes: 
  - tweak: "Haywire ammunition no longer causes small EMPs. It now does higher damage to synthetics, prosthetics, and machinery, and strikes them as burn damage. For non-synths, they're very weak, and strike as brute."
  - rscadd: "Haywire ammunition damage is mitigated if you have a surge prevention module, but will also drain its uses. Damage reduction scales with the strength of your surge module."
  - rscadd: "Adds haywire ammunition for .45, 5.56mm, and shotgun shells."
  - rscadd: "Added additional haywire ammunition to the armory less-than-lethal locker (.45s and shotguns). Removed a few rubber clips."
  - rscadd: "Added haywire ammunition to advanced combat vendors and some response teams."
  - rscadd: "Haywire shotgun shells and slugs can be produced in the protolathe."
  - rscdel: "Removed shotgun slugs from the autolathe."
  - tweak: "Gauss slugs now do more damage and have slight armor penetration."
  - tweak: "The ion rifle's lethal mode (AoE) uses almost all of its charge. Stun mode has been weakened slightly and can only be used five times between charges, down from ten."
  - imageadd: "New sprites added for some haywire ammo clips and magazines."
