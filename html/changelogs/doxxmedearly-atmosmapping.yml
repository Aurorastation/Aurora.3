changes:
  - maptweak: "In atmos, slightly remapped the area near the mix tank, to separate the Engine to Mix from the other parts of the mix line, since only the former should be going through the radiator loop."
  - maptweak: "Removed the digital valves in atmos near the canister ports. Also added a manual valve to the Hydrogen tank pipeline."
  - bugfix: "Removed some duplicated pipes in atmos."
  - bugfix: "The pump that supplies air to the station now begins the round turned on. Seems important."
  - bugfix: "Large gas tank monitors should no longer report the gas temperature as a percentage."
  - bugfix: "Made the gas room of the starboard-side thrusters airless, to match the port side."
