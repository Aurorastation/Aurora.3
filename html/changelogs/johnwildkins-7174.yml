# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Microwave, oven, deep fryer, cereal maker, and candy maker circuit boards added."
  - rscadd: "You can now upgrade and deconstruct/reconstruct microwaves and other cooking appliances. Note: advanced parts currently do not affect microwaves, and deconstructing a microwave yields no parts. This will be fixed in the overhaul."
  - tweak: "Oven efficiency now starts at 70% and grows slower to 100%."
  - tweak: "Oven heat loss due to door open cut down massively, to 1.5x heating from 4x."
  - tweak: "Deconstructing a machine now returns cable coil. Wirecutting a blueprint on the cable-coil stage lowers it to the 'secured blueprint' stage, and as such now requires a wrench to remove."
  - bugfix: "Printing a smart-fridge board no longer gives you an operating table circuit board."
  - bugfix: "Deconstructing a machine no longer displays the incorrect icon state."
  - bugfix: "Candy and cereal makers no longer fail to cook."
