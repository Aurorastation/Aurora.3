changes: 
  - maptweak: "Moved the gibber to a more convenient position and added in safety windows, as well as floor markings to make it more obvious that you shouldn't stand infront of it."
  - maptweak: "Re-arranged the kitchen slightly. Removed one of the redundant meat spikes."
  - tweak: "Gibber no longer throws meat with force comparable to being hit by a train. It will still seriously injure you though, and when emagged will mortally wound you."
  - tweak: "Gibber no longer throws meat onto itself."
