# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a new chemical, dextrotoxin.  It is made somewhat wastefully with carpotoxin, soporific, and phoron."
  - rscadd: "Dextrotoxin briefly makes it hard to walk straight before paralyzing you. People under the effects of dextrotoxin cannot move or use the radio, but can still speak."
  - tweak: "Dextrotoxin replaces zombie powder in any antagonist item that previously contained it. Zombie powder is still possible to manufacture."
