# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Added an option to character setup to allow shells to play human. This alters what species is listed in records, and is no longer tied to the shell's tag status."
  - qol: "Moved the 'Species' entry in records out of employment records and to the global records. It really didn't make sense that medical and security couldn't see what species a person is."
