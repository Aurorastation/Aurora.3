# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - refactor: "Refactored implants to be easier to modify in the future."
  - refactor: "Refactored the known implant system to use an implant's variable rather than a list in the body scanner, and allowed for implants completely hidden from all scanners."
  - tweak: "Replaced the sprites for implanters, implant cases, implants, and implant pads. Sprites by Wowzewow (Wezzy)."
  - tweak: "Implant pads are now used by placing the case onto them (or vice versa), and implanters now directly take implants from cases."
  - rscadd: "Added the EMP implant, which will emit a burst of EMP when activated."
  - rscdel: "Temporarily removed the compressed matter implant from the uplink, as it is difficult to use and needs new logic to fix up."
  - rscadd: "Explosive implants now have an anti-tamper system that will warn if it is exposed in surgery, and can be triggered via radio signal as well as a custom phrase set in an implant pad."
  - tweak: "Completely removed the emote triggering system from all implants, in favor of an action button-based system."
  - rscadd: "Re-added loyalty implants, which still exist in the canon. These are currently unused, but variants exist for staff and event usage."
  - bugfix: "Mindshield implants, when implanted, will no longer give the old loyalty implant messages. These are exclusive to loyalty implants."
