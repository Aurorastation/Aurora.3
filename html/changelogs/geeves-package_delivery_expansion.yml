changes:
  - rscadd: "Cargo delivery packages now have colored tags on them which should hopefully make it easier to distinguish between them, instead of changing the entire package's color."
  - rscadd: "Delivering a package now outputs another, allowing you to continuously deliver throughout the round, should you choose to."
  - bugfix: "Fixed cargo packages runtiming on the runtime map."
