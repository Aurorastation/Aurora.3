changes:
  - rscadd: "Added back in the Eridani Private Military Corporation uniforms, headwear and renamed the Eridani Sec Sleeve Patch appropriately to an Eridani item instead of PMCG. All which should be available in the loadout!"
  - rscadd: "Added the PMCG Armband, which was made fully by Memescope (who also reworked the current PMCG sprites to the nifty, clean and organized state as they currently are)"
  - bugfix: "Fixed EPMC AP's IDs being invisible, also using the incorrect PMCG uniforms instead of their proper ERT"
  - bugfix: "Properly names PMCG items as PMCG instead of just PMC."
