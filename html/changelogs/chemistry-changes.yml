changes: 
  - rscadd: "The majority of medicinal chemicals have added side-effects - nothing too disruptive."
  - rscadd: "Added a variety of overdoses to chemicals that were lacking overdoses."
  - rscadd: "Some medications now contraindicate one another and should not be taken together."
  - rscadd: "Certain chemicals have been totally overhauled to make them more unique."
  - tweak: "The default OD threshold is now 20u. Poor communication between doctors is now more likely to result in ODs."
  - tweak: "More medical chemicals will appear on medical scans as opposed to being registered as unknown substances."
  - rscadd: "Introducing Butazoline, the dermaline equivalent for treating brute injuries. It cannot treat arterial bleeding like Bicaridine, however."
  - tweak: "Saline is now the chief blood restorative medication and only works intravenously at a medium transfer rate."
  - tweak: "Iron/Copper/Sulphur pills now restore blood at half their previous rate."
  - tweak: "Any combination of mortaphenyl, oxycormorphine and alcholic beverages will be dangerous. Don't mix them."
  - tweak: "Dexalin Plus overdoses are now extra toxic to vaurcae - too much oxygen for their gas exchange system to handle at a time."
  - tweak: "Soy Sauce is now made with salt instead of sulphuric acid."
  - tweak: "Brute First-Aid Kits have had their contents shuffled about to include a health analyser and 2 bicaridine pills."
  - rscadd: "Added more chemical contraband that can be found in maintenance and the cargo warehouse."
  - rscadd: "You can now purchase Sideeffect-Be-Gone autoinjectors from the Traitor Uplink. Combat Medical Kits also contain 1 of these autoinjectors."
  - tweak: "Pill bottles which spawn at round-start and in kits now have the dosage of the pills on the label to prevent accidental overdoses."
  - spellcheck: "Some chemical typos have been fixed. Uncapitalised chemicals have been capitalised."
  - tweak: "You can find all of the chemical changes on the feedback thread (https://forums.aurorastation.org/topic/14761-full-chem-rework-feedback-thread/) as it may be a while before the Chemistry Guide is updated to reflect these changes."
