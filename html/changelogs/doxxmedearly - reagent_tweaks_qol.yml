changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed bugged recipes that were 'eating' reagents unless the exact amount was added all at once, such as cheese wheels."
  - bugfix: "IV drips now respect the transfer amount when TAKING blood, instead of using the max rate. Blood donations should be much safer now."
  - tweak: "Removed the undetectable chem_dose that would linger after a reagent was totally metabolized. This prevents weird interactions when being given a dose of a reagent soon after metabolizing a previous dose of the same reagent."
  - tweak: "Soporific takes a little longer to kick in and knock someone out."
  - tweak: "Some medicines now have a minimum dosage before certain affects will be applied. This minimum is typically 1u or less, and prevents abusing IV drips on 0.01u transfer rate to get the full power of some medications, mainly Dexalin and painkillers."
  - tweak: "Saline Plus restores blood at half the rate. It is still the most effect way to restore blood outside of transfusions."
