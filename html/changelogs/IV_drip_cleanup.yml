changes:
  - tweak: "Tweaked the IV drip tank indicator icon to use the percentage helper instead of the exact gauge updating, and some IV drip code clean up and oversight patching."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the IV drip not automatically retracting the installed mask if you stripped it from someone and then wearing it yourself."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the IV drip outputting a specific message even though the installed tank gets spilled everywhere when not secured."
