# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes:
  - rscadd: "Cerulean slimes have been re-added and are used to create Extract Enhancer - all in line with the wiki."
  - rscadd: "Sepia slimes have been re-added. They are not used to create cameras anymore as the wiki suggests. They instead can be used to open wood/cardboard material portals (with water) or leather/hide material portals (with blood) - for use resupplying departments or creating fancier golems."
  - rscadd: "Pyrite slimes have been re-added. They are not used to create paint/crayons anymore as the wiki suggests. They instead can be used to transmute various chemicals into stronger variants, some examples include: dexalin -> dexalin plus; radium -> unstable mutagen, EZ nutrient -> diethylamine."
  - tweak: "Docility Potions have been renamed to Docility Serums. The Advanced Docility Potion is now also a lighter pink, complimenting the slime it's acquired from."
  - rscadd: "Some extract abilities have been added to various slimes to compliment their pre-existing abilities: Green Slimes (silver & carbon -> bluespace crystal), Red (sugar -> glycerol; phoron -> nightshade), Pink (water -> paxazide), Oil (water -> plastic/glass material portal)."
  - balance: "Gelds the slime glomp attack - them pouncing and latching onto prey is already strong enough, especially considering 'friends' of slimes may still, on occasion, be glomped by RNG."
  - balance: "Some extract abilities don't just require 1u of a chemical to activate, some now have a larger 'chemical cost' - mostly reserved for the more powerful abilities."
  - tweak: "Slime jelly no longer nukes the liver with 100-300 toxins out of nowhere. Instead, it deals genetic damage over time, just like slimes actually do."
  - tweak: "Now that Slime jelly's healing properties can be used safely, it now treats both brute and burn damage to the same degree as butazoline and dermaline. It also reoxygenates blood."
