changes:
  - tweak: "Tweaked dual-wielding penalties to not be as harsh and to fire faster. It still works best with smaller weapons such as pistols."
  - tweak: "Tweaked dual-wielding to only apply if its smaller or the same size as your main firearm, this makes it easier to pull out a pistol and use only that."
