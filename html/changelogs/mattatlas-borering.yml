changes: 
  - rscadd: "Borer has been added as its own gamemode, requiring 3 borer players and 20 people readied."

  - tweak: "Zorch, the eye laser power, has been made into a lightning arc power instead. It works like before, except it shoots teslabolts."
  - tweak: "Disable, the EMP ability, has been made into a localized EMP ability. It activates the EMP effect on items. You now activate it by targeting right hand and clicking on items."
  - tweak: "Increased borer psi awakening chemical cost to 150."
