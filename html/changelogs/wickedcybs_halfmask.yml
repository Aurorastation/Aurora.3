# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds a new gas mask variant, the face mask. It filters airborne contaminants but does not protect the eyes!"
  - maptweak: "Face masks have been mapped to various locations. Research, medical, engineering and security can expect to see them in their departments. Off-station antags and beacon teams have them available as well."
