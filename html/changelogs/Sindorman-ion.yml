  - rscadd: "NT weapons division is proud to announce the release of new The NT Mk70 EW Halicon ion rifle. Compared to the predecessor Mk60, new MK70 now has two firing modes: stun and lethal. In stun mode IPC's will be stunned for 5 seconds per shot(not stackable). If the target that was hit is not an IPC it wil EMP the object(not area effect). Lethal mode works exactly like the old Mk60. In stun mode rifle will have maximum 10 shots until depleted. Unfortunately due to new module that allows to regulate the intensity of EMP pulse, in order to fit everything in same size rifle the capacity was reduced resulting in lethal mode having max shots is 6. NT representatives suggest security try and use stun mode on IPCs and avoid using lethal force unless absolutely necessary."
