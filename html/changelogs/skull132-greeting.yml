changes:
    - rscadd: "Added a new \"Server Greeting\" system to replace the massive garbled dump of info people get in the lower right panel. Coloured tabs indicated things that need attention. The window can be opened from the OOC tab as well, via the \"Open Greeting\" button."
    - rscadd: "Admins (with R_SERVER flag) can now edit the message of the day from within the game, with the \"Edit MotD\" button in the Server tab. Memos can be edited by any admin from the \"Edit Memo\" button in the same tab."
