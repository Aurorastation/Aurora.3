changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a Crash ability to exosuits. Uses the suit's mass to attempt to break through obstacles, sustaining some damage in the process."
  - tweak: "Buffed Ripley exosuit armor values significantly, and durand armour slightly. Firefighter ripley also buffed, but is slower than base ripley."
  - tweak: "Greatly increased the health values of some high-security airlocks."
  - bugfix: "Airlocks, tables, girders and windows now behave a bit more consistently when exploded. All airlocks are a bit more resistant to explosions when bolted."
  - rscadd: "Added some more narrator voices to exosuits."
  - rscadd: "Added some warning sounds for exosuits when low on power, or badly damaged."
  - tweak: "The power drain of EMPs used on exosuits no longer scales with the cell. A better power cell can now survive more EMP hits. Drain level is a little lower for the starting cell."
  - tweak: "EMP damage against exosuits reduced by 20%"
