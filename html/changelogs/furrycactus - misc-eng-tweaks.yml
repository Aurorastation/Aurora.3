# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - maptweak: "Fixed a subgrid and maingrid overlap in Engineering Deck 1 wiring."
  - maptweak: "Configured Reactor Waste to Mix regulator in Atmospherics to start OFF at roundstart, and Mix tank Input and Output as well."
  - maptweak: "Gave Atmos Tech access to the INDRA SMES room, but not to the reactor or control room itself. Removed the access they had to the reactor room itself through the bolted door (likely oversight)."
  - maptweak: "Made a tiny handful of stylistic changes with some floor decals and computers."
