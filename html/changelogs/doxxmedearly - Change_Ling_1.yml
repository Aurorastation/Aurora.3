changes: 
  - rscadd: "When lings suck people dry, those people are added to the ling's internal hivemind, where they can communicate with eachother."
  - rscadd: "The hiveminded person can ghost, which will tell the ling and the others in the hivemind that they have left."
  - rscadd: "The ling can eject people out of their hivemind. This has no benefit to the ling, unless the person was salty. This ability does not make salt okay."
  - rscadd: "Lings become hardier as they acquire more genomes. The more you absorb, the more resistant to pain, stuns, weakness, etc. you become."
  - rscadd: "Lings earn less genes and chemicals from absorbing non-player or old corpses. After a certain amount, they won't earn any from them."
  - tweak: "Hallucination sting is a little less potent, but still very strong. There's a cap to prevent stacking a ton of stings on one person in a short window. Just because hallucinations aren't LRP anymore doesn't mean you should be."
  - tweak: "Lesser lings are a bit better at shaking off stuns, weakness, and pain."
  - tweak: "Ling adrenaline sacs cost lowered from 30 chems to 20."
  - tweak: "Ling death sting now injects less cyanide, but now also makes the target dizzy, temporarily blinds them, and silences them for longer."
  - tweak: "Ling deaf sting is now stealthy, but the target will still receive a message."
  - tweak: "To offset the higher base resistances of changeling, regenerative stasis now takes almost twice as long before you can revive, and is more expensive to use. This is when you are most vulnerable- be careful."
  - bugfix: "You no longer find a pulse on a changeling who is faking death. This affects manually checking, scanners, and HUDs."
  - bugfix: "Ling transformation sting should work now."
  - bugfix: "Buying changeling powers in stasis should no longer spam you with every power you've bought previously."
  - bugfix: "Changelings can properly revive without losing their verbs, even if they're in lockers or scanners."
  - bugfix: "Items embedded into simple mobs should no longer prevent them from ventcrawling."
