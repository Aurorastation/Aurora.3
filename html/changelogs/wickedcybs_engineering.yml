changes:
  - rscadd: "Ports the emergency forcing tool from Baystation. On Aurora it's been renamed to the 'rescue axe' and true to the name, is a hand axe used to force your way into situations where a crowbar would not suffice. You can find these in fire closets or in the CE/Atmos tech engineering lockers."
  - tweak: "The old retro full face gas masks have been swapped for the clear faced gas mask variant within fire closets and engineering lockers."
  - tweak: "Fireclosets have been buffed overall. They'll usually contain a very small amount of inflatables totalling to one door, two walls. The EMTs and the bridge will have variants that have two doors, three walls. The EMTs also get a ladder in their firecloset."
  - tweak: "Firesuits can have a few more things in their suit slots. Crowbars of any type, the rescue axe, the fire axe and full oxygen tanks."
