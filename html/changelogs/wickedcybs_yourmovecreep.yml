  - tweak: "The Eridani beacon team has had a massive restructuring. It's been renamed to the Eridani Asset Protection Team. The EAPT now has two focuses. Protection and medical care. Its IAC holdovers are mostly gone at this point and its members have improved weaponry and a new leader role that can be selected. I have tried to make sure this wouldn't be too overbearing. They are not doom marine giga killers but they can get the job done at least."
  - tweak: "The energy rifle has been slightly nerfed to not fire as fast as you can click now. It still fires very fast though."
  - tweak: "The Strike hardsuit spawns with additional modules for non-ninja antags and beacon responders. The additional modules are more themed around its policing aesthetic and include a mounted gun, actuators and more."
