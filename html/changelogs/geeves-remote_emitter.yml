  - rscadd: "You can now place a signaler on an emitter to remotely activate it. It follows the same activation rules as a standard user."
  - rscadd: "EMPing an emitter now causes it to toggle its state, if it's ready to fire."
  - rscadd: "Emagging an emitter now doubles the amount of burst shots it takes and halves the minimum and maximum times between bursts."
