# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - tweak: "Wielding firearms is now done via the activate-held-object verb, aka the Z key in hotkey mode or clicking on the item with itself."
  - tweak: "Firemode switching has been offloaded to a new verb, toggle-burst-fire, which is invisible but macro-able. It has a new HUD icon to the right of the pockets."
  - tweak: "Other kinds of behaviour that aren't firemode switching have been offloaded to another invisible verb, unique-action, which also has a new HUD icon to the right of the pockets."
  - tweak: "Switching firemode now plays a small sound."
